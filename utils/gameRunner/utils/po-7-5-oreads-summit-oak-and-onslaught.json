IT'S TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! 🎙️\n\nWell hello there, sports fans! This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you with a real humdinger of a showdown! We are perched precariously at the High-Pass Pitch for Game 5 of this Winners Bracket clash! The air is thinner than the excuses of a captured rogue, and if the altitude doesn't get you, the Vertigo surely will! It is a do-or-die atmosphere, folks! The series is on the line, and the tension is thicker than a swamp giant’s neck! \n\nOur visitors, **Oak & Onslaught**, are currently the darlings of the realm! I haven't seen popularity like this since someone accidentally left the vault door open at the Church of Pecune! I just saw Milt Casady leading the squad in a synchronized chant that’s probably causing avalanches three peaks over! And look at Wynnie Faina and Normi Glaudia—those crazy kids are wearing their boots on the wrong feet again! 👟 If that doesn't scream 'Warden-backed excellence,' I don't know what does! Symer Crissy is already giving the Trollball a heroic backstory; I hope it includes a chapter on how it’s about to be spiked into the ground! 🌳💥\n\nOn the other side, **The Oread's Summit Tamers** are looking to defend their home turf, though their fan section is looking a bit... well, non-existent! Zero popularity points? Ouch! That’s colder than the frost on Geth the Gravelord’s toes! Mitran Mariand is busy exchanging well-wishes with his opponents—honestly, where is the malice? Where is the demonic spite? 😈 At least Odericus Juxon is slapping her own helmet until her ears ring—now that's a ritual I can get behind! \n\nWith Sir Randy probably watching from a distance with that fancy, over-designed bow of his, the Wardens' prestige is at stake! Can the Tamers pull off a miracle in the thin air, or will Oak & Onslaught steamroll their way to the next bracket? Grab your goggles and your grog, because we are ready for some beautiful, mountain-top carnage! 🏔️⚔️🏈","postGame":"### 🏟️ THE SUMMIT IS CONQUERED! OAK & ONSLAUGHT SWEEP THE SERIES! 🏟️\n\nBoy-oh-boy, what a magnificent display of unbridled ferocity! Oak & Onslaught didn't just win; they absolutely dismantled the Oread's Summit Tamers with a 4-0 shutout that will be talked about in the taverns for decades! We saw teeth flying, armor buckling, and enough injuries to keep Ahron Latashia busy until the next era of the Everwar! The mountain air might be thin, but the action was heavy, and the Tamers just couldn't find their footing on their own High-Pass Pitch! 🏔️✨\n\nThe game started with a frantic scramble for possession. Abner Seidel snagged the leather head early, showing off those lucky garish undergarments as he bobbed and weaved through the center! But the real fireworks began when the hitting started. Normi Glaudia, perhaps inspired by the druids' shifting terrain, delivered a bone-shattering tackle to Dric Trilley that sent her straight to the dirt with a nasty injury! 🦴 It was a clear message: the Wardens weren't here for the view; they were here for the violence!\n\nNot to be outdone in the mayhem department, Wynnie Faina—despite his boots being on the wrong feet—absolutely leveled Clippard Burr! It was a crunching blow that had the few goats in attendance bleating in terror! The Tamers tried to mount a response, with Alwyn Wandy lining up a long-distance shot that could have changed the momentum, but the thin air must have messed with his aim because it sailed wide left! The first half was a defensive slugfest where the grass was stained greener than a Fey circus tent! 🤡🛡️\n\nAfter the halftime break, where the healers worked their miraculous (and frankly, annoying) magic to bring the fallen back to life, the intensity only ramped up! Alwyn Wandy came out looking for blood and found it, tackling Millham Evangeline so hard she was out of the play before she could even stick another feather in her plume! It was a momentary spark for the Tamers, but it was quickly snuffed out by the overwhelming pressure of the Oak & Onslaught defense! 🚑🔥\n\nEma Ulrick, swinging her cutlass like a woman possessed, decided Edme Virgil had spent enough time on the field. She delivered a tackle that sent Virgil back to see Carn Tibbetts for more emergency stitching! The Oread side was falling apart faster than Governor-King Zenku’s composure during a mask fitting! The Wardens' 'Natural Advantages' were on full display as they controlled every inch of the shifting gully! 🌳⚔️\n\nThen came the scoring! Milt Casady, the chant-leading captain himself, found a gap in the center field defense. He didn't hesitate, launching a beautiful throw that zipped through the goal for a 2-point score! 🎯 The crowd (well, the Onslaught fans who hiked all the way up here) went absolutely wild! It was a display of precision that would make Sir Randy’s fancy bow look like a child’s toy! The Tamers looked winded, gasping for oxygen that just wasn't there!\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Wynnie Faina wasn't finished with Edme Virgil. As soon as the poor soul stepped back onto the pitch, Faina was there to deliver another punishing tackle, injuring Virgil for the second time in one match! Talk about a bad day at the office! That kind of repetitive cruelty is exactly why I love this game, folks! It’s not just about the ball; it’s about making sure the other guy can’t walk for a week! 🏥🔨\n\nMilt Casady decided to put the final nail in the mountain's coffin. He broke away into the Home 2-Point zone and launched another spectacular shot that hit nothing but net! Another 2 points on the board, bringing the lead to a commanding 4-0! The Tamers were left standing there looking as confused as Sir Tanos in a library! It was a masterclass in playoff dominance, pure and simple! 📍💥\n\nAs the final whistle echoed across the peaks, the scoreboard told the story of a complete and total shutout. The Oread's Summit Tamers, despite their mountain-top advantage and sea shanties, couldn't put a single point on the board. They’ll be heading down to the Losers Bracket with more than a few bruises and a lot of questions about their grocery lists! Oak & Onslaught, meanwhile, are celebrating like they just found a chest of Valos's gold! 🧹🏆\n\nI have to tip my horns to the Wardens; they played with the grit of a demon and the coordination of a well-oiled execution machine. Mitran Mariand’s polite well-wishes didn't do him much good when he was staring at the grass from a horizontal position! Maybe next time the Tamers will try a little less grog and a little more 'fighting for your life.' But hey, that's the beauty of Trollball—there’s always next week for more suffering! 😈🏈\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the High-Pass Pitch! What a game, what a series, and what a glorious day for violence! I’m going to go see if I can find some of that non-alcoholic grog to dump on a hero's head. Remember, in Osterra, the only thing that stays dead is your dignity after a 4-0 loss! Stay nasty, sports fans! 🌙🎙️👿","week":5,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-7-5-oreads-summit-oak-and-onslaught","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Abner Seidel in zone Center Field","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Kass Fogel, but Kass Fogel blocks it!","Milt Casady passes the ball to Affra Yanaton!","Teria Ravo runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Kass Fogel tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but misses!","Normi Glaudia Tackles Dric Trilley and INJURES THEM!","Symer Crissy tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Milt Casady tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Hole Bowerman tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Symer Crissy throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Mitran Mariand!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Kass Fogel, but misses!","Wynnie Faina Tackles Clippard Burr and INJURES THEM!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Swamy Ahasuerus, but misses!","Millham Evangeline tries to Tackle Mitran Mariand, but misses!","Odericus Juxon runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Alwyn Wandy, but Alwyn Wandy blocks it!","Alwyn Wandy shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Hole Bowerman in zone Center Field","Swamy Ahasuerus tries to Tackle Teria Ravo, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Zadoc Wyatan tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but Symer Crissy blocks it!","Millham Evangeline throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Mitran Mariand!","Odericus Juxon tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Mitran Mariand, but misses!","Swamy Ahasuerus tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Zadoc Wyatan, but misses!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Swamy Ahasuerus, but misses!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Saloma Talich, but misses!","Normi Glaudia tries to Tackle Edme Virgil, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Kass Fogel in zone Center Field","Alwyn Wandy Tackles Millham Evangeline and INJURES THEM!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Saloma Talich, but misses!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Mitran Mariand, but misses!","Dric Trilley tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but misses!","Ema Ulrick Tackles Edme Virgil and INJURES THEM!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Alwyn Wandy, but misses!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Alwyn Wandy, but misses!","Swamy Ahasuerus tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Normi Glaudia tries to Tackle Mitran Mariand, but misses!","Alwyn Wandy shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Affra Yanaton in zone Center Field","Dric Trilley tries to Tackle Wynnie Faina, but Wynnie Faina blocks it!","Odericus Juxon tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but Symer Crissy blocks it!","Saloma Talich tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but Symer Crissy blocks it!","Wynnie Faina tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Dric Trilley, but Dric Trilley blocks it!","Milt Casady shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Ema Ulrick in zone Center Field","Teria Ravo tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Zadoc Wyatan tries to Tackle Milt Casady, but misses!","Wynnie Faina Tackles Edme Virgil and INJURES THEM!","Millham Evangeline runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Teria Ravo runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milt Casady shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Mitran Mariand in zone Center Field","Alwyn Wandy tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but misses!"],"bracket":"Winners"}
