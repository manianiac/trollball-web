      "Hellooooooo, Trollball fanatics, and welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the magnificent Su'akour Bowl! And what a venue it is! You can really taste the history in the air, folks, and a little bit of sulfur too! That's how you know it's gonna be a good one!\n\nTonight, our home team, the mighty Brimstone Fire Eaters, are getting ready to bring the heat! I tell ya, these players are backed by some real heavy-hitters from Eponore, and you know they play with that same fire! I saw their man Glassman Solley getting ready by... washing his hands with dirt! Now that is a player who understands what this game is all about! Getting down and dirty before the first whistle even blows! You love to see it!\n\nAnd facing them down, all the way from the crumbling ruins of Kerlauger, it's the Runeguard! Now, they've got the backing of those White Ravens, and you know what that means: they're probably tough, but not a lot of fun at parties. But hey, they know how to get ready for a match! I saw Lashondra Niehaus having a teammate just wallop her in the shoulder to get the blood pumping! That's the spirit! A good punch is better than any warm-up stretch, I always say!\n\nThe air is thick with tension and noxious fumes, the crumbling walls are packed with screaming fans, and two teams are ready to leave it all on the field! Will the Fire Eaters burn bright in their home fortress, or will the Runeguard's stone-cold tactics win the day? Stick around, folks, because the carnage is about to begin!",
    postGame:
      "WOW! What a game! What a finish! Folks, if you didn't have a good time tonight, you might not have a pulse! From the first bone-crunching tackle to the final whistle, that was pure, unadulterated Trollball action! An absolute classic!\n\nWhen the dust settled and the healers got to work, the visiting Kerlauger Runeguard walked away with the victory, squeaking by the Brimstone Fire Eaters with a final score of 3 to 2! A heartbreaker for the home crowd, but what a battle they gave us!\n\nThe game started with an absolute demolition derby! It wasn't about the ball, it was about sending a message! Wylde Jutta took out Shepperd Trefler with a Voulge! Harilda Sigsmond answered back, dropping Nachison Icken with a Battle Axe! Glassman Solley sent Vivia Namara for a nap! It was a symphony of destruction!\n\nWe even had a beautiful, simultaneous knockout! Lashondra Niehaus and Glassman Solley met in the middle of the field and BOTH went down! You can't ask for more commitment than that! The healers were earning their pay from the opening bell!\n\nThe first big push came from the Fire Eaters' Selimah Tully, who made a great run before getting absolutely flattened by Lashondra Niehaus in another double KO that sent the trollball flying! That's when the Runeguard took over, with Lashondra making a heroic, multi-zone dash toward the goal, only to fall short on the shot! The grit! The determination!\n\nThen came the halftime whistle, a much-needed breather for everyone involved. All players back on their feet, ready to inflict more glorious pain!\n\nThe second half started with a Runeguard explosion! Benjie Foulk found an opening and BANG, touchdown! 1-0 Kerlauger! Before the Fire Eaters could even regroup, Johnna Beetner did it again! ANOTHER touchdown! Just like that, it was 2-0! The visitors were running away with it!\n\nBut the Fire Eaters weren't done! Their boy Glassman Solley made a fantastic run, trying to claw his team back into it, but was stopped cold by a fantastic defensive play from Harilda Sigsmond! The Runeguard took that momentum and cashed it in, with Benjie Foulk scoring THEIR THIRD TOUCHDOWN! 3-0! It looked like it was all over!\n\nBut you NEVER count out the Brimstone Fire Eaters! With time ticking away, Harilda Sigsmond tried to run the ball, but was blocked by none other than Selimah Tully, who snatched the ball away! And then... oh, and then! Tully didn't run, folks! He planted his feet in Center Field, wound up, and LAUNCHED that trollball through the air! It sailed through the goal for a magnificent TWO-POINT SHOT! The crowd went berserk! It was 3-2!\n\nWhat a comeback! What a cannon! But alas, it was too little, too late. The Runeguard managed to hold on through the final, frantic moments to secure the win. A tough loss for the squad from Eponore, but that two-point shot from Selimah Tully will be talked about for weeks! What a game, folks! What a beautiful, brutal game!",

      "Hello, hello, and a blood-soaked welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend of the field, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the magnificent Glowstone Terrace! The mountain winds are whipping, the market crowd is roaring, and that famous Glowstone Glare is making everything shimmer! What a perfect night for some bone-crunching action! 🏟️\n\nTonight, we've got a real barn-burner for you, folks! The hometown heroes, The Confluence Captains, are squaring off against the travelling titans, The Greenwatch! The Captains, representing the Guild of the Black Sky, are looking to make a statement here on their home turf. I see Ladew Evelina getting ready by chugging a raw egg, shell and all! Now that's commitment! And listen closely... you might hear O'Conner Maighdlin warming up by speaking only in rhymes. Annoying? Maybe. Effective? We're about to find out!\n\nBut don't count out The Greenwatch! They've made the long trip and they look hungry! I saw Verne Methuselah getting a good 'grip' on the Trollball by rubbing it in her armpits, a time-honored tradition! And you've gotta love the focus of Herriott Dhiren, chewing on a bitter root for night vision. She'll need it under this Glowstone Glare! The teams are lining up, the tension is thicker than bog mud, and the Trollball is about to fly! Get ready for chaos, carnage, and pure, unadulterated SPORT! Let's get this game started!",
    postGame:
      "WOW! What a game, ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between! That was Trollball at its absolute finest! From the first whistle to the last, the field was a whirlwind of beautiful, brutal poetry in motion. If you weren't on the edge of your seat, you might have already been knocked unconscious! An absolute spectacle here at the Glowstone Terrace! 💥\n\nThe first half kicked off with more brawling than a tavern on payday! It was a symphony of destruction! Troy Jorgan laid out Deach Sharlene with a Kirkhammer, only for Richia Pazit to answer right back with a Pike to the gut! The healers were earning their keep from the get-go, I'll tell ya that much!\n\nAnd would you believe it, we had a double KO! Behl Berstine and Goldenberg Rimola decided they'd both had enough of being conscious and took each other out of the action simultaneously! You just love to see that kind of mutual respect and aggression! That's the spirit of the game right there!\n\nAmidst the chaos, the Confluence Captains drew first blood! After a failed run by her teammate, Belding Chloe scooped up the loose ball, dodged a tackle, and then, with incredible poise, sank a magnificent 2-point shot from Away Field! The home crowd went absolutely wild! A 2-0 lead for the Captains!\n\nBut hold on to your helmets, folks, because The Greenwatch came roaring back! Darin Berliner got the ball, powered through the defense into Home Field, and answered with a 2-point shot of their own! Just like that, we were all tied up! The back-and-forth action was simply breathtaking! What a response!\n\nThe rest of the half was a glorious, messy scramble! Fumbled passes, dropped balls, and to cap it all off, another spectacular double knockout! Vonni Geoff and Nobe Haukom traded blows with a Sap and a Mallet, sending both of them to the healers' tent for a nice nap. The whistle blew for halftime with the score knotted at 2-2. A perfectly balanced contest of violence and skill!\n\nWhen we came back for the second half, the carnage picked right back up where it left off! Salahi Bushey and Behl Berstine immediately took each other out in another stunning double KO. These players were leaving it ALL on the field tonight, folks!\n\nThen came the run of the game! The Greenwatch's own Salahi Bushey, fresh from the healer, picked up the ball deep in his own territory and took off like a demon out of the Abyss! He weaved through player after player, running the ball from the Away 2-Point zone, through Away Field, through Center Field, and all the way into Home Field! An absolutely legendary run that covered almost the entire length of the pitch!\n\nBut after that heroic effort, the pass was fumbled! The Captains recovered, only to be blocked by Rese Halpern of The Greenwatch, who ripped the ball away! With the defense in disarray, Halpern saw an opening and punched it through for a touchdown! The Greenwatch takes the lead, 3-2! What a stunning turn of events!\n\nThe game ended as it began: with pure, unadulterated violence. One last double KO for the road, as Caves Cestar and Salahi Bushey decided to call it a night. And that's the final whistle, folks! What a match! The final score from the Glowstone Terrace: your visiting The Greenwatch take it with a score of 3, defeating the hometown The Confluence Captains, who finish with 2! A hard-fought victory on the road for The Greenwatch! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! Now THAT was Trollball! 😈",

      "Helloooooo Trollball fans, and welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting live from the absolutely scorching Sun-Baked Bowl, deep in the Great Desert! The heat is rolling off the sand in waves you can see, and let me tell you, it's the perfect weather for some hard hits and glorious gridiron violence!\n\nTonight, we have a fantastic matchup for you! In one corner, making their way from the cool, damp earth of their home, we have The Wyrmwood Stronghammers! These folks are tough as old roots, and they've got some interesting ways of getting ready for a match. I saw Autumn Jodoin chugging a raw egg—shell and all!—while Ultun Barthelemy was busy braiding a teammate's nose hair. That’s the kind of dedication you love to see! If only the so-called leaders in Eponore had that kind of focus, maybe they wouldn't lose all their best warlocks.\n\nAnd in the other corner, basking in their home-field advantage, are The Desert Spectres! These warriors are as unforgiving as the sun above us. And their rituals? Just as intense! Angelita Darce is sporting a freshly half-shaved mustache for the occasion, a bold and frankly beautiful choice. And you gotta love a player like Steve, who's already got a betting pool going on who will score first. Now that's a competitor after my own black heart, unlike that Yarp fella who won't even take my wagers anymore!\n\nThe air is thick with anticipation and sand, folks. Will the oppressive heat cook the Stronghammers, or will their forest fortitude win the day? Will the Spectres use the desert winds to their advantage? It's anyone's game, and it’s about to get brutal! Grab your refreshments, place your bets, and get ready for some TROLLBALL!",
    postGame:
      "WOW! WHAT A FINISH! WHAT A GAME! Folks, if you weren't on the edge of your seat for that one, you might need to check if you've been KO'd! That was Trollball at its absolute finest, a back-and-forth brawl that went right down to the wire!\n\nFor those of you just tuning in, you missed an absolute classic. The Desert Spectres have snatched victory from the jaws of the Wyrmwood Stronghammers in a grueling overtime battle, with a final score of 2 to 1! What a spectacle!\n\nThe second half kicked off with a bang! Huesman Ring of the Spectres made a magnificent run, but the field immediately turned into a beautiful canvas of carnage! We saw Ultun Barthelemy take Steve out of the action, only for Huesman Ring and Sondra Elaina to knock each other out simultaneously! You love to see that mutual destruction! It's a kind of beautiful, brutal poetry that someone like Dame Terra Monteforte, who just plays with dirt, could never understand.\n\nAnd the hits kept on coming! Sabian Gleason and Fidellia Mozelle traded blows and both went down for a nap! The healers were earning their pay tonight, folks, especially the Spectres' own Verlee Dacia, who seemed to be everywhere at once!\n\nAmidst the chaos, the Spectres drew first blood! Bahr Ethelstan found the freshly-revived Steve with a perfect pass, and Steve powered it in for the first point of the game! The home crowd went wild! It looked like the Spectres might run away with it.\n\nBut you can never count out the Stronghammers! After a frantic series of fumbles and turnovers at center field, Rebane Kendy uncorked a beautiful throw to Autumn Jodoin. While Jodoin's shot at the goal fell short, the ever-ready Ultun Barthelemy was right there to scoop up the loose troll head and punch it in for a score! We were all tied up, one to one!\n\nThat's when things got REALLY interesting. The intensity cranked up to eleven! We saw more double knockouts as Odelia Abbott and Heyes Iver traded devastating shots! Then Steve and Sondra Elaina decided they hadn't had enough of each other and took each other out AGAIN! This is the kind of passion that wins championships, not hiding behind walls and fancy titles like those Chairmen in the Guild of the Black Sky.\n\nThe clock ran out, but the score was tied! That's right, folks, we were headed to OVERTIME! The tension was so thick you could cut it with a Kriegsmesser!\n\nOvertime was a masterclass in desperation and grit. Rebane Kendy of the Stronghammers came out like a man possessed, knocking out a player and moving the ball deep into Spectre territory. It looked like Wyrmwood was poised to win, but Steve, ever the spoiler, laid out Godart Urissa and forced the ball loose!\n\nThen, in the final, frantic moments, the ball found its way into the hands of Eileen Mikihisa. After being blocked once and losing the ball, Mikihisa fought to get it right back and, with the game on the line, broke through the defense and SCORED! THE DESERT SPECTRES WIN! THE DESERT SPECTRES WIN IN OVERTIME! An unbelievable finish to an unforgettable game! Your final score: The Desert Spectres 2, The Wyrmwood Stronghammers 1! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! See you next week for more glorious violence!",

      "Hello, hello, and welcome back, sports fans, to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite demonic announcer, Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting live from the most disgustingly clean stadium in all of Osterra, The Aegis Field! The very air here smells of soap and good intentions, it's turning my stomach! But the action on the field promises to be anything but clean!\n\nTonight, we have a classic clash of titans! In this corner, hailing from the delightful, sinking marshlands of Ebon Gate, my personal favorites, the team with more grit than a Gethic sandstorm, The EBON GATE CORRUPTORS! I've heard the locker room is pure, concentrated energy tonight! Smith Syst is daring teammates to eat live worms for luck, Judi Carrington is getting everyone's blood pumping with a sea shanty so off-key it could shatter glass, and Amedeo Bari is polishing his boots with bacon grease for that extra slippery advantage! That's how you prepare for a proper game, folks!\n\nAnd in the other corner... them. The home team, the Haven Lights. I guess they're here, too. Their pre-game rituals are... something else. We've got Riffle Heyde drinking an entire waterskin of lukewarm water—riveting stuff! And Coward Tarton is over there kissing her biceps. I suppose when you don't have any real strategy, you have to hope your muscles can think for themselves! This pristine field won't know what hit it when the Corruptors bring some real, honest-to-goodness chaos to the game. Get ready for a slobberknocker, because the Corruptors are here to play, and to break things!",
    postGame:
      "Well folks, I... I need a moment. That was one of the most brutal, back-and-forth, heart-stopping games of Trollball I have ever had the privilege to witness. The final score does not tell the whole story, not by a long shot. The Haven Lights may have taken the win with a final score of 4 to 3, but let the record show that the Ebon Gate Corruptors fought with the fury of a caged demon!\n\nRight out of the gate, after a brief halftime reset, the action was nonstop! The Lights got the ball, but did that matter to As Utter? NOT ONE BIT! He immediately went on a rampage, sending Farand Keil AND Zwart Bunns to the knockout pile with that glorious Greatsword of his! That's the spirit we love to see!\n\nThe Lights, bless their little hearts, managed to string a few passes together, but the Corruptors' pressure was immense. The ball came loose and our own Judi Carrington snatched it up, ready to make a break for it! He was stopped, but the message was sent: nothing will come easy for Haven tonight!\n\nAnd the hits just kept on coming! Olnek Vizzone laid out Dickenson Beker with his sickle! Then we saw not one, not two, but THREE sets of mutual knockouts! Carrington and Beker took each other down in a blaze of glory! Then Wieren Ivar and Napoleon Anzovin traded blows and went down together! The healers were sprinting back and forth like panicked goblins!\n\nAmidst the absolute carnage, the Corruptors showed their brilliance! After a missed shot by the Lights, Amedeo Bari picked up the troll head, dodged a block, and made a spectacular run down the field! He was just stopped short of the goal, but who was there to clean it up? The one and only Bullion Iglesias, who scooped up the ball and punched it in for a CORRUPTORS SCORE! The crowd went wild!\n\nBut the game was tied, and we were heading into the nail-biting intensity of OVERTIME! The field was a warzone! More mutual KOs! As Utter and Dickenson Beker went down swinging! Olnek Vizzone and Berkin Waters followed them to the sidelines! Smith Syst and Zwart Bunns flattened each other! It was beautiful, beautiful violence!\n\nBall carrier Farand Keil thought he had a clear path, but Olnek Vizzone, a true hero of the match, laid him out and forced the fumble! The ball was loose, a scramble ensued! Tybi Reo of the Lights got her hands on it, heaved a desperate pass... and it was FUMBLED! YES! \n\nOur chance had come! The magnificent Ellette Paz scooped up the ball for the Corruptors! This was it, folks! The game-winning run was in her sights! She dodged, she weaved, she ran for glory... only to be blocked by Riffle Heyde. A tragic, heartbreaking stop at the one-yard line.\n\nAnd then, in the cruelest twist of fate I've seen since Sir Tanos was freed from my old home, Riffle Heyde, the lukewarm water drinker, slipped through a gap and scored the winning point for the Haven Lights. A devastating finish to an incredible game.\n\nDon't you dare hang your heads, Corruptors. You left everything on that field tonight—sweat, blood, and a whole lot of unconscious opponents. You played the game the way it's meant to be played. You may have lost on the scoreboard, but you won in glorious, beautiful violence! We'll be back next week, you can count on it! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!",

      "Helloooooo Trollball fanatics, and welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! 🏈 This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the magnificent Stronghold Bailey in New Ravenfall! The air is electric, the cobblestones are cold, and the crowd is howling from the ramparts, just aching for some righteous violence! And what a matchup we have for you tonight, folks!\n\nIn one corner, we have the visiting team, all the way from the chilly frontier, The South Pole Yetis! These are some tough customers, hardened by the cold and ready to rumble. I've been watching their warm-ups, and it is a sight to behold! You've got Isborne Krause getting his teammate to wallop him in the shoulder just to get the blood flowing, and the delightful Udela Dorkus over there... is she licking a whetstone? She is! That's the kind of dedication you love to see in this sport! This team is hungry, and they've traveled a long way to knock some heads. 🥶\n\nAnd in the home corner, behold The New Ravenfall Commanders! Playing on their home turf, with the echoes of the castle amplifying every brutal hit! These players are sponsored by some of the realm's most... notable personalities. Yes, friends, I'm talking about the likes of Sir Tanos and that so-called God King, Artorias. I'm sure they'll be watching from their comfortable towers, clutching their pearls at the beautiful carnage their team is about to unleash! The Commanders are getting ready in their own special ways, with Estes Adrian munching on honeycomb for a 'sweet' victory and Theis Loredo sharing a bit of fermented fish. It smells like victory, or something like it! 🏰\n\nTwo teams, one troll head, and a whole lot of mayhem on the way! Will the scrappy Yetis from the south pull off an upset on the cobblestone pitch? Or will the Commanders defend their stronghold with iron and fury? Stick around, folks, because the opening whistle is about to blow, and you don't want to miss a single, bone-crunching second! 💥",
    postGame:
      "HOLY SMOKES, FANS! That was a game for the ages! 🤯 If your heart is still pounding, you're not alone! What a comeback! What a battle! When the final whistle blew after a grueling overtime, it was your New Ravenfall Commanders who stood victorious over The South Pole Yetis with a final score of 5 to 3! An absolute spectacle of grit and carnage!\n\nThe second half opened with the Yetis looking to run away with it! They were already sitting on a lead when play resumed, and they came out swinging! Hilaire Guevara wasted no time, snatching up the troll head and dodging a block from Jessalin Zobias to get into scoring position. She looked, she aimed, and she launched a perfect two-point shot! SWISH! 🎯 The Yetis extend their lead, and the home crowd was stunned into silence!\n\nBut the Commanders weren't about to lie down in their own bailey! The bodies started flying immediately. Coussoule Bidle of the Yetis took out Fleme Alis with a nasty mallet strike, but the Commanders' Rhett Gavrilla answered right back, putting Ajit Serge on the ice with that massive Woodsman's Axe of theirs! It was a meat grinder out there, folks! 🪓\n\nThe Yetis kept the pressure on. Duky Orelee, showing some real fancy footwork, scooped up the ball and blazed into the home field, slipping right past Pirozzo Opal. He drove straight for the goal, shrugging off a last-ditch effort from Dusa Curson to score another point for the South Pole! It was all Yetis, all the time!\n\nThen, the tide began to turn. The middle of the half was a beautiful, bloody stalemate. Weapons were ringing, players were dropping, and the healers were earning their keep! Moir Sass laid out Selima Si with a trident, and then Rhett Gavrilla, that absolute menace, knocked out Sale Tocci! Theis Loredo then sent Tocci *back* to the healer's tent for good measure! It was glorious chaos! 💥\n\nThe Commanders fought for every inch. Fleme Alis got the ball and connected on a fantastic pass to Jessalin Zobias, who made a desperate lunge for the goal! He came up just short, but the ball was deep in enemy territory. And then, the play of the game! Udela Dorkus scooped up the loose ball, but Jessalin Zobias met her in a furious clash! The Quarterstaff met the Military Fork, and BOTH players went down in a heap! A double knockout! The troll head was loose, and the game was up for grabs! ⚔️\n\nSomehow, in that whirlwind of violence that followed, the Commanders clawed their way back! The official scorers could barely keep up with the action, but points were scored, bones were broken, and by the end of regulation, the score was tied! We were headed to OVERTIME, folks!\n\nThe overtime period was a cagey affair, with both teams exhausted but desperate. Passes were fumbled, runs were stuffed, and the tension was thick enough to chew! We saw another magnificent double KO, as Hilaire Guevara and Theis Loredo took each other out of the action simultaneously! This is Trollball at its finest, my friends!\n\nTurnovers galore! Pirozzo Opal had the ball, but Coussoule Bidle ripped it right out of his hands! Then Sayers Erdda tried a run, only to be stuffed by Fleme Alis, who took the ball for the Commanders! The momentum was swinging like a pendulum! Fleme Alis went on an absolute tear, knocking out two Yetis players in quick succession!\n\nAnd then, with time ticking away, it happened. Theis Loredo, back in the game and looking for revenge, got her hands on the ball in scoring range. The Yetis defense scrambled, but it was too late! She fired a perfect shot, right through the goal for TWO POINTS! The crowd erupted! 🎊 The New Ravenfall Commanders win it in overtime! What a finish! A stunning comeback victory for the home team! I bet even Artorias cracked a smile at that one... or maybe he just called his guards. Who cares! What a game! 🏆",

      "Hello, hello, hello Trollball fanatics, and welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite announcer, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live with what promises to be an absolute spectacle of carnage and athletic prowess! Tonight, we have a real barn-burner for you as the hometown heroes, Oak & Onslaught, host the visiting bruisers, The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures!\n\nNow folks, Oak & Onslaught are playing on their home turf at Fletchings Field, and you know what that means! The local druids have been hard at work, so we can expect some 'Shifting Terrain' tonight! Trees might just get up and walk, gullies could open up at any moment – it's a beautiful, unpredictable mess out there! These Wardens, like that fancy archer Sir Randy, love their nature, and tonight they're making it part of the game! Let's see if it helps them or just gets in the way of the real action.\n\nBut don't you count out the visitors! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures are a tough bunch, hailing from Dame Terra Monteforte's neck of the woods. Their healer, Lian Denton, gets ready for the game by drinking a shot of hot gravy! You heard me right, folks, HOT GRAVY! If that doesn't tell you they're here for a good time and a messy fight, I don't know what will! Keep an eye on Gabriele Klehm, who warms up by kissing the Trollball right on its stitched nose. A little tenderness before the tenderizing begins! It's the disciplined chaos of the Wardens versus the pure, unadulterated chaos of New Monteforte! Get your popcorn ready, this is going to be one for the ages!",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! WHAT! A! GAME! Blood, mud, and a two-point stunner! That's Trollball at its finest, and your final score from Fletchings Field is The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures: 2, and the hometown Oak & Onslaught: 0! A shutout victory on the road for the Chaos Creatures!\n\nThe first half was a masterclass in mutual destruction! It was a beautiful, beautiful stalemate of pure violence. The whistle blew and not ten seconds later, Hole Bowerman of Oak & Onslaught was knocked clean out by Gabriele Klehm, who was ALSO knocked out in the exchange! A double KO to start the party! You love to see it!\n\nThe ball spent more time on the grass than in anyone's hands! Wolbrom Ariella picked it up only to get into another double knockout with Milt Casady. It was a revolving door of consciousness out there! The healers were sprinting back and forth like panicked goblins, and I loved every second of it!\n\nPlayers were dropping left and right! Raouf Dragone and Affra Yanaton took each other out! Wolbrom Ariella and Millham Evangeline sent each other to dreamland! It was a glorious, scoreless slugfest, and by the time the halftime whistle blew, the field was littered with warriors taking a well-deserved nap.\n\nAfter the break, the Chaos Creatures came out with fire in their eyes! Alben Diantha scooped up the ball, dodged a block from Abner Seidel, and made a slick pass to Placido Kora. The crowd was on the edge of their seats!\n\nAnd then it happened! The play of the game! Placido Kora, cool as a demon's soul, took aim from the Home 2-Point zone... and SHOT! The ball sailed through the air, a perfect arc of stitched leather, and went straight through the goal! TWO POINTS for the Chaos Creatures! An absolute thing of beauty!\n\nOak & Onslaught, to their credit, didn't just lie down. They fought back with everything they had. Affra Yanaton made a heroic run, trying to answer back for the home team.\n\nBut the Chaos Creatures' defense was a brick wall with spikes! Alben Diantha flattened Affra Yanaton, though they took each other out in the process. That's the kind of sacrifice that wins championships, folks!\n\nNormi Glaudia gave the home crowd a spark of hope, picking up the loose ball and charging all the way into scoring territory! The comeback was on! You could feel the tension!\n\nBut it was not to be! Fogel Raynold of the Chaos Creatures came flying in and laid out Normi Glaudia right at the goal line! Another double KO, another dream shattered! The ball lay tantalizingly close to the goal, but time ran out on the Wardens.\n\nAnd that's the final whistle! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures came into a hostile, shifting stadium and taught the Wardens a lesson in beautiful brutality! A well-earned victory, sealed by a single, perfect shot. This is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that while 'heroes' are busy with their politics, the real legends are being made right here on the Trollball field! Until next time, stay bloody!",

      "Hello, Trollball fanatics, and welcome to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolutely breathtaking, and I do mean that literally, High-Pass Pitch in Oread's Summit! The air up here is so thin it'll make your lungs scream, and the winds are colder than a tax collector's heart! It's the perfect weather for some bone-shattering, soul-stirring Trollball!\n\nTonight, our hometown heroes, The Oread's Summit Tamers, are looking to tame more than just mountains as they face off against the visiting New Prosperity Profits! The Tamers are looking FIERCE, folks! I saw Saloma Talich getting a teammate to punch him square in the shoulder just to get the blood flowing, and Edme Virgil is warming up their vocal cords with a sea shanty that could curdle milk! Now THAT is preparation!\n\nThe Profits aren't just here to count their gold, either! These scrappers from the Guild of the Black Sky mean business. I watched Yoshi Cathy eat a raw onion, layer by layer, without shedding a single tear. If that doesn't tell you he's ready to bring the pain, I don't know what will! And let's not forget Pulchi Benyamin, who's fueling up by eating a dandelion, stem and all! A little bit of nature before the unnatural carnage begins!\n\nThis is going to be a clash of titans, a battle of wills, a symphony of destruction! Will the high-altitude advantage and bizarre rituals of the Tamers carry them to victory? Or will the cold, calculating precision of the Profits pay dividends? Grab your grog, hold on to your helmets, because the whistle is about to blow, and the beautiful brutality is about to begin!",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME! WHAT A NIGHT! Folks, if you weren't on the edge of your seat, you must have been knocked out of it! The Oread's Summit Tamers have defended their home turf with a stunning display of power and precision, putting down the New Prosperity Profits with a final score of 4 to 1! An absolute masterclass in violence and scoring!\n\nThe action started faster than a rumor in the Adventurer's Guild! The Profits' Gladdie Farika scooped up the ball, but BAM! Clippard Burr of the Tamers laid them out with a lance! But in a twist you only see in Trollball, Farika took Burr down with them! A double knockout on the first play! Oh, it brings a tear to my eye!\n\nWith the field already littered with bodies, the Tamers seized the moment! Dric Trilley grabbed the troll head and went on a rampage, bowling over Pellikka Concettina like a ninepin! This is what the game is all about, my friends!\n\nAnd then, the moment of magic! Trilley zipped a pass to Zadoc Wyatan, who was waiting in the 2-point zone. Wyatan took aim, let it fly, and SWISH! Two points for the Tamers! The hometown crowd erupted!\n\nBut they weren't done! Not by a long shot! On the very next possession, Saloma Talich got the ball at center field, looked at the goal, and just CHUCKED IT! I've never seen anything like it! The ball sailed through the air and right through the hoop for another TWO POINTS! In the blink of an eye, the Tamers were up 4-0! The Profits looked absolutely stunned!\n\nThe first half was a whirlwind of beautiful brutality! Swamy Ahasuerus and Aufmann Tedric traded knockouts, Edme Virgil and Clippard Burr took each other out of the game... the healers were working harder than Sir Artorias's publicist! It was glorious chaos, a testament to the spirit of the sport!\n\nAfter a much-needed halftime where the healers scraped our warriors off the pitch and glued them back together, the second half began. The Profits knew they had a mountain to climb, and to their credit, they came out fighting!\n\nKrueger Jacinthe finally put the visitors on the board, bulldozing his way into the endzone for a touchdown! A glimmer of hope for the Profits, making the score 4-1. Could they mount a comeback for the ages?\n\nThey certainly tried! Abramson Doxia made a fantastic run deep into Tamer territory, dodging and weaving, looking for an opening. But the Tamers' defense stiffened, becoming an unbreakable wall of muscle and steel. Possession was wrestled back and forth, the ball dropped and recovered in frantic scrambles that looked more like a mosh pit than a sporting event! It was magnificent!\n\nIn the end, the Tamers' early lead and tenacious defense were too much to overcome. As the final whistle blew, it was Swamy Ahasuerus holding the ball, and the victory, firmly in her grasp. A well-deserved win for The Oread's Summit Tamers, who showed everyone tonight how Trollball is played in the mountains! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that a broken bone is just a souvenir from a game well played!",

      "Hello, hello, HELLO, sports fans, and welcome back to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the very edge of the world, it seems! We're at The Cliffside Pitch in Southport, home of the Narwhals, where the only thing more dangerous than the players is the real estate! I'm telling you folks, one wrong step and you're fish food! The sea spray is so thick you can taste the salt, and those gale-force winds are whipping up something fierce! It’s the perfect weather for TROLLBALL!\n\nTonight, our hometown heroes, The Southport Narwhals, are taking on the swampy stompers themselves, The Zmeigorod Snessengers! Now, the Narwhals are looking mighty confident on their home turf. I saw Malcolm Goer getting ready by rubbing the Trollball in their armpits for 'extra grip'—that's the kind of dedication that wins championships, my friends! It’s certainly a better look than some of those stuffy heroes from Eponore. You won't see Sir Tanos doing that with Sunbringer, I'll tell you that for free!\n\nThe Snessengers, fresh from the bogs of Zmeigorod, don't look intimidated by a little ocean water! Their warm-up rituals are a sight to behold! Delija Dowling was seen chugging a raw egg, shell and all, while Evalyn Pierrepont was polishing his helmet with a live snail! That’s the kind of strange bog-magic that High Priestess Oona probably frowns upon, which makes me love it all the more! Will their swampy toughness overcome the Narwhals' seaside savagery? We're about to find out! Get ready for a bone-crunching, rock-smashing, tide-turning good time! It's almost time for kickoff!",
    postGame:
      "WOW! WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! An absolute cliffhanger here at the Cliffside Pitch, and I mean that literally! When the salt spray settled and the last whistle blew, your Southport Narwhals have clawed out a victory by the skin of their tusks! The final score: The Southport Narwhals, 4, and the Zmeigorod Snessengers, 3! An absolute battle from start to finish!\n\nThe action started immediately! The first half was a symphony of destruction! We had Arni Griffith for the Snessengers making a bold run right out of the gate, but the real story was the mutual annihilation! Alded Sanjay and Loralyn Lyndy knocked each other clean out of the game in a beautiful, simultaneous display of violence! That's the kind of parity you love to see!\n\nBut the Narwhals drew first blood on the scoreboard! Braden Gaile, standing in the Away 2-point zone, took a look, took a breath, and launched that troll head through the goal for a spectacular 2-point score! The hometown crowd went absolutely bananas!\n\nNot to be outdone, the Snessengers answered right back! Rose Kluge, with ice in her veins, fired off a long bomb of her own from Center Field! It sailed through the air, perfect and true, for two points! We were all tied up, and the tension was thick enough to chew!\n\nThe rest of the half was just pure, unadulterated chaos! More mutual knockouts! Dare Wynnie and Cilurzo Sochor took each other out! Then Arni Griffith and Torey Dannye followed suit! The healers, Waldon Tadeo and Sand Denys, were working harder than a one-legged goblin in a kicking contest! What a display of carnage before the halftime whistle!\n\nAfter the break, the intensity only ramped up! The Narwhals came out swinging, with Malcolm Goer channeling the fury of a storm and knocking out two Snessengers back-to-back with that glorious Morning Star! That's how you make a statement!\n\nThe ball was a hot potato, dropped and recovered amidst a flurry of devastating blows. Alded Sanjay and Cilurzo Sochor had a rematch that sent them both to the healers' tent once again, leaving the troll head just sitting there for the taking!\n\nAnd who should scoop it up but Crescint Sonia for the Narwhals! With a clear look at the goal, he let it fly from the 2-point zone and... IT'S GOOD! Southport takes a 4-2 lead, and it looked like that might just seal the deal!\n\nBut you can never, EVER count out a team from Zmeigorod! With time winding down, the Snessengers mounted a furious comeback! Northway Orran, a whirlwind of aggression all night, grabbed the ball and plowed through the defense for a hard-earned touchdown! The score was 4-3! The Snessengers were just one point away from tying it all up!\n\nThe final moments were a desperate, frantic scramble, but the Narwhals' defense held on! They protected their lead as the final whistle blew, securing a magnificent victory for the home team! A tip of the hat to King Nezmear; his team fought like the werewolves he's so fond of! A hard-fought win and a fantastic start to their season! As for the Snessengers, they have nothing to be ashamed of. They brought the pain, they scored, and they made the Narwhals earn every single inch. A loss, but a glorious one! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! KEEP. IT. BRUTAL!",

      "Hello, hello, HELLO sports fans, and welcome back to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolutely dazzling, and frankly quite distracting, Prismatic Pavilion! The sun is shining, the lagoon is splashing, and the stage-planks are just begging for someone to get knocked through them! What a perfect day for some wholesome violence! 🏟️✨\n\nTonight, our home team, the ever-unpredictable Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, are getting ready to put on a show! And I mean that literally! I've been watching their warm-ups, and it's pure theater! Pompei Hephzipa is out here striking poses that would make a statue blush, and Melesa Zelten is leading a chant that's rattling the very stilts of this stadium! These performers, much like their patron Kython, know that the greatest art is a well-executed tackle! They're looking loose, they're looking loud, and they look ready to rumble!\n\nBut hold on to your helmets, folks, because sailing in from Tortell, it's the Privateers! These swashbucklers from Cedar Hill aren't here to 'make things happen' with a friendly chat like Elspeth Ortell; they're here to make skulls crack! Their pre-game rituals are a thing of demonic beauty! You've got Lilithe Royce using leeches to 'lighten their step'—now that's dedication! And don't even get me started on Dib Tufts, who just chugged a raw egg, shell and all! That's the kind of energy you need to win! The Bizarres might have the home-field advantage, but the Privateers look hungry, and I, for one, can't wait to see which of these incredible teams will paint this pretty pavilion red! Let's get ready for TROLLBALLLLL! 🪓🩸",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME! WHAT A GLORIOUS, BACK-AND-FORTH BRAWL! When the final whistle blew and the last groans of the downed faded away, your visiting Tortell Privateers stood victorious over the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, with a final score of 4 to 2! A spectacular display of grit and glaives, folks! An absolute masterpiece of mayhem!\n\nThe action started faster than a thief from Falric's wallet! The Privateers came out swinging, and I mean that literally! After a quick fumble, Ellan Elburt got his hands on the Trollball, but not before his teammate Goldberg Tova sent Pompei Hephzipa to the knockout zone with a beautiful swing of their Glaive! That's how you set the tone! 💥\n\nWith a man advantage, Ellan Elburt didn't hesitate! He wound up from the 2-point zone and let it fly—SWISH! Two points for the Privateers right out of the gate! The crowd here at the Pavilion was stunned silent! The Privateers kept up the pressure, with Payson Jan dropping Gagliano Tallbott for a little nap on the sidelines. The Bizarres looked rattled!\n\nBut you can't keep a good performer down! Pompei Hephzipa, fresh off the healer's table, came back with a vengeance, immediately knocking out Dib Tufts! And then, a moment of beautiful, violent poetry: Ellan Elburt and Kristin Kronfeld charged each other, weapons flashing, and took each other OUT in a spectacular double KO! You love to see it! The first half ended with another double knockout between Bush Heiner and Dib Tufts, leaving the Privateers up 2-to-nothing at the break.\n\nHalftime came and went, and the players came back refreshed and ready for more carnage! And they did not disappoint! The second half opened with YET ANOTHER double KO, this time between Willa Lois and Kidder Starkey! Three double KOs in one game! Is that a record?! I think that's a record!\n\nWith the bodies piling up, Dib Tufts of the Privateers found an opening. He saw his shot and he took it, sinking a magnificent 2-pointer from away territory! That put the visitors up 4-0, and it looked like it might be over for the Bizarres. It's the kind of decisive action that would make even a stoic like Sir Tanos crack a smile!\n\nBut hold on! The Bizarres still had some magic left! Demp Chet got the ball, shook off a defender, and fired a perfect shot of his own! TWO POINTS! The home team was on the board, and the Pavilion erupted! The score was 4-2, and the comeback was on!\n\nThe Bizarres fought tooth and nail to the very end. Melesa Zelten laid out Ellan Elburt with a spear, and the fighting was fierce across the field. Goldberg Tova was a menace all night for the Privateers, picking up a second knockout to seal their reputation as a player to watch.\n\nUltimately, time was not on the Bizarres' side. They couldn't find that last score they needed, and the game ended in the possession of the Tortell Privateers. A hard-fought, well-deserved victory for the visitors on the road!\n\nMy friends, this is what Trollball is all about! Not some lofty ideals or saving the world, but pure, unadulterated athletic competition at its most brutal and beautiful. Congratulations to the Tortell Privateers! And a hearty round of applause for the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, who gave us a show we won't soon forget! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! ❤️‍🔥",

      "# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! 🎙️\n\n**Welcome, welcome, welcome!** Grab your roasted rat-on-a-stick and settle in, you miserable wretched souls! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, your favorite voice from the void, broadcasting LIVE to all planes of existence! Can you smell that? No, not the lingering stench of my cousin Kuromi's cooking—that is the smell of SULFUR! 🌋 We are live from the crumbling, noxious ruins of the **Su'akour Bowl**!\n\nTonight's matchup is a clash of ideologies, a battle of the self-righteous versus the tree-hugging weirdos! In the visiting corner, representing the mossy overgrowth of **The Grove**, we have **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers**! 🌲🔨 Look at them! **Sabian Gleason** is down there literally counting clouds. Someone tell him there's no roof on this dump! And there's **Autumn Jodoin**, who just swallowed a raw egg whole. Disgusting. I love it! They've got the favor of the Green Goddess, but let's see if vines can stop a hatchet to the face!\n\nAnd for the home team, putting on their boots in a fortress that smells like a dragon's backside, it's **The Brimstone Fire Eaters**! 🔥 These poor saps are funded by the kingdom of **Eponore**. That's right, folks, the same kingdom that houses **Sir Tanos** and that preening peacock **Artorias the Moonslayer**! I bet Artorias is listening right now, polishing his armor and crying about justice. Look at their healer, **Raphael Miyasawa**, kissing their own biceps in the dugout. Vanity! Pure vanity! The air is thick, the ground is uneven, and the violence is guaranteed! Let's play **TROLLBALL**! 👹🏈",
    postGame:
      "# 🩸 AND THE WHISTLE BLOWS! 🩸\n\n**BY THE BLACKENED PIT!** What a display of incompetence, violence, and sheer chaotic glory! The final score stands: **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers 4, The Brimstone Fire Eaters 2**! The Grove takes the victory, and the Eponore darlings go home to cry into their polished shields! Hah!\n\nLet's recap this absolute bloodbath, shall we? The game started slow, folks. It was a defensive stalemate that would make a stone golem weep with boredom. **Sabian Gleason** picked up the ball early for Wyrmwood but couldn't find an opening to save his life. He was looking left, looking right, probably looking for more clouds to count! Meanwhile, **Oona Jane**—yes, the namesake of that pesky High Priestess—decided to wake everyone up by bashing **Odelia Abbott** into next week with a Cudgel! 💥 That's how you start a greeting!\n\nBut the real action started when the bodies hit the floor simultaneously! We saw a beautiful display of mutual destruction when **Rebane Kendy** and **Bollinger Susette** exchanged blows. A Bastard Sword meets a Hatchet, and BOOM! Both players down! 🚑 The healers, **Raphael** and **Hamburger Marthe**, were working overtime, sweating more than **Governer-King Zenku** at a beauty pageant!\n\nWe saw fumble after fumble in the midfield. **Sabian Gleason**—who frankly looked like he was playing with butter on his gloves—got blocked by **Lowson Hersh** and dropped the rock. **Autumn Jodoin** tried to play hero for the Stronghammers, scooping it up and gunning for the score, but fell short! The agony! The mediocrity! It warms my cold, dead heart.\n\nThen, the moment that proves the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** are a dysfunctional mess! In Overtime, **Campball Fink** was making a run, looking good, looking strong... and who stops them? THE OPPOSITION? NO! It was their own teammate, **Nigel Rothmuller**! 🤣 Nigel tackled Campball and stole the ball! Can you believe it? The Eponore teamwork in action, ladies and demons! **Sir Artorias**, are these your tactics? Betrayal in the ranks!\n\nThe violence in Overtime was exquisite. **Ultun Barthelemy** and **Wylde Jutta** engaged in a lovely dance of death—Partisan vs Voulge—resulting in *another* double knockout! Then **Rebane Kendy** and **Selimah Tully** did the exact same thing! The field was littered with bodies! It looked less like a sports arena and more like one of **Geth the Gravelord's** holiday parties! 🎉💀\n\nUltimately, the game came down to the wire. With bodies steaming in the cool mine draft, **Cornela Piscatelli** of the Stronghammers found the loose ball. While **Calvinna Isador** and **Glassman Solley** were busy stabbing each other to sleep in the background, Cornela launched a shoot from the Away 2-Point zone... and **IT'S GOOD!** 🎯\n\nA 2-point dagger to the heart of the Fire Eaters! Wyrmwood walks away with the win, leaving the Brimstone squad to explain to **Morgwae** and the rest of the \"heroes\" why they lost to a bunch of bean-snorting cloud-counters! \n\nWhat a night! Injuries, betrayal, friendly fire, and a crushing defeat for the establishment! I couldn't ask for more. This is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off. Remember: if you can't win, make sure the other guy can't walk! Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙😈",

      "Gooooooood evening, blood sports fans! 🎙️ It’s Tuesday Night Trollball, and I’m your host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you LIVE from the blindingly bright Glowstone Terrace! 🏔️✨ The air is thin, the wind is howling off the World's Spine, and the Confluence market crowd is absolutely RABID for violence tonight! I love it! The smell of unwashed merchants and impending spinal injuries is truly the perfume of the gods!\n\nTonight, we have a clash of cultures! Coming up from the muck and mire, we have the Zmeigorod Snessengers! 🐍 They represent The Grove, which means my old friend—and by friend, I mean the terrifying bog-entity—Valos the Eternal is probably watching. I noticed Arni Griffith down on the field whispering to the Trollball. Apparently, his ritual involves giving the ball a \"heroic backstory.\" Listen, pal, the only story that ball needs to tell is the sound it makes when it cracks a skull! 📚🚫 And keep an eye on Delija Dowling; I just watched him swallow a raw egg, shell and all. That’s the kind of intestinal fortitude I look for in a champion!\n\nFacing them are the home team, the Confluence Captains! 💰 Supported by the Guild of the Black Sky, these folks know the value of a gold coin and a sharp blade. I see Chairman Brennen Farno up in the luxury box—still looking like he’s never cracked a smile or a beverage in his life. Loosen up, money priest! 🪙 Down on the field, Vonni Geoff is slathering his arms in sticky tree sap. Is that legal? Who cares! If you aren't cheating, you aren't trying! And Belding Chloe is... rubbing the ball on her armpits? Unique grip strategy, but I respect the commitment to the funk! Get ready, Osterra, because the whistle is about to blow! 🩸🔔",
    postGame:
      "What a game! What a beautiful display of chaotic aggression! 🏟️💥 The dust has settled on the Glowstone Terrace, and the home crowd is going absolutely bananas as the Confluence Captains take the victory over the Zmeigorod Snessengers with a final score of 4 to 2! The Guild's investments pay off again, folks!\n\nThe violence started immediately, just the way I like it! ⏱️ Right out of the gate, Avaria Revell of the Snessengers introduced Richia Pazit to the floor with a brutal Bastard Sword strike. 🗡️ But the Captains weren't just taking it; despite some early fumbles, the action was fierce. We saw Kleinstein MacGregor—who apparently counts prime numbers for fun (NERD ALERT 🤓)—deliver a nasty Machete hit on Belding Chloe to clear the path.\n\nThe Snessengers struck first on the scoreboard! After Gere Cordelie rumbled down the field, it was the math-whiz Kleinstein MacGregor who scooped up the loose ball and punched it in for the touchdown! 🏈 1-0 for the swamp-dwellers! But the Captains answered back with style! Deach Sharlene picked up the leather in Center Field and launched a rocket—a 2-point Shoot that sailed right through the uprights! Boom! 💥 2-1 Captains!\n\nThen, folks, it turned into a butchery. We had bodies hitting the floor faster than my hopes for a Haven Light defeat! 💀 Avaria Revell and Carnahan Laud got into a tussle and—get this—knocked EACH OTHER out simultaneously! A double KO! Beautiful! 🚑 And not moments later, Alded Sanjay and Deach Sharlene did the EXACT SAME THING! The healers, Kant Langill and Waldon Tadeo, were sweating more than a goblin in a sauna trying to keep up with the carnage!\n\nWe went into halftime with the crowd screaming for more blood, and the second half did not disappoint. Delija Dowling started us off by removing Vonni Geoff from consciousness with a Seax. Efficient! 🔪 The Snessengers were pushing hard to catch up, but the Captains' defense was stiff, leading to yet another double knockout between Northway Orran and Ladew Evelina. I haven't seen this many people sleeping on the job since the last meeting of the Eponore Council!\n\nArni Griffith, the storyteller, tried to write himself a hero's journey, running the ball through multiple zones, dodging tackles like he was dodging plot holes. But when it came time to throw the winning pass? He couldn't find an opening! 😂 Classic tragedy! However, Evalyn Pierrepont was there to pick up the pieces, scoring a touchdown to tie the game at 2-2! The tension was palpable!\n\nBut you can't keep a greedy Guild team down! With the clock ticking, Vonni Geoff—freshly revived and still sticky with sap—grabbed the ball in the Away 2-Point zone. He didn't run. He didn't pass. He SHOOT! 🏹 And he SCORED! Another beautiful 2-pointer to put the Captains up 4-2!\n\nThe Snessengers tried to mount a final assault, with Delija Dowling grabbing the ball as time wound down, and Kleinstein MacGregor taking out Ladew Evelina one last time for spite, but it wasn't enough! The Confluence Captains hold the field! 🏆\n\nI imagine Valos is sinking back into her bog in shame right now, while Cyfnerth the Butcher is probably already recycling the losers into meat pies. 🥧 A hearty congratulations to the Captains, and a word of advice to the Snessengers: less pre-game dancing, more weapon sharpening!\n\nThis has been Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that while heroes may save the world, only Trollball makes it worth living in! Stay violent, Osterra! 😈🎙️",

      "Good evening, sports fans, thrill-seekers, and connoisseurs of carnage! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE from the sweltering, blistering, absolutely magnificent **Sun-Baked Bowl**! 🎙️🔥 The air is thick with sand, sweat, and the delicious promise of dehydration! We are deep in the Great Desert, folks, and the only thing hotter than the sun is the temper of these athletes!\n\nTonight, we have a clash of aesthetics! In the away corner, bringing the glitter and the glam (and hopefully the gore), we have **The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres**! 🌟 I saw **Pompei Hephzipa** warming up earlier with some aggressive theatrical poses—terrifying stuff, really, if you’re frightened of interpretative dance! And keep an eye on **Milo Nelie**; I saw them tracing invisible sigils over their heart. Witchcraft? Heartburn? Who cares, as long as it hurts someone!\n\nAnd defending the dunes, the home team, **The Desert Spectres**! 🌵💀 These folks are tough as old leather. I caught **Fidellia Mozelle** sniffing a piece of burnt wood before the match—odd, but I respect the commitment to carbon! And my personal favorite, **Steve**—just Steve—is down on the sidelines organizing a betting pool on who bleeds out first. Put me down for five gold pieces on the Healer, Steve! 💰\n\nWill the Bizarres’ Prismatic flair dazzle the desert dwellers? Or will **Geth the Gravelord's** crew bury the circus in the sand? The heat is on, the leather is loose, and I am READY FOR PAIN! Let’s play TROLLBALL! 👹",

The **Desert Spectres** have clawed their way to victory in a match that went all the way to the bitter, bloody end!\n\nLet's talk about the second half! It started with absolute chaos. **Aggri Cookie** of the Bizarres decided that **Shelman McQuoid** didn't need to be conscious anymore and introduced them to the business end of a Halberd! Whack! 💥 Then we saw a beautiful double-knockout—my favorite kind! **Bahr Ethelstan** and **Willa Lois** just deleted each other from the timeline simultaneously. Poetry in motion!\n\nBut the Bizarres struck first on the scoreboard! **Pompei Hephzipa**, the master of posing, launched a shot from Home Field—a 2-pointer that sailed through the uprights like a flaming arrow! 🏹 The Prismatic Troupe must be dancing in their tents, thinking they had it in the bag!\n\nBut NO! The Trollball gods demand suffering! We went to **OVERTIME**! ⏳\n\nIt was a comedy of errors! **Kristin Kronfeld** missed a shot! **Demp Chet** missed a shot! **Steve**—oh, poor gambling Steve—missed a shot! It looked like nobody wanted to win! Bodies were flying everywhere! **Muscolo Jaehne** and **Milo Nelie** beat each other senseless in another double-KO! The Healers, **Essa Pattie** and **Verlee Dacia**, were working harder than a goblin in a gold mine!\n\nFinally, with the sun beating down and the fans screaming for blood, **Fidellia Mozelle** found the opening! 🏃💨 Aggri Cookie tried to block, but crumbled like a dry biscuit! Fidellia crossed the line! TOUCHDOWN SPECTRES!\n\nThe final score stands: **The Desert Spectres 3, The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres 2**! 🏆\n\n**Geth the Gravelord**, you dusty old bone-bag, your team actually pulled it off! As for **Kython** and his circus performers... back to the Starlight Lagoon with you! Maybe work on your tackling instead of your makeup! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!

      '# ☠️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL: THE MUD AND THE BLOOD! ☠️\n\nGood evening, gore-hounds and violence enthusiasts! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE from the most beautiful, treacherous patch of swamp in all of Osterra—**The Sinking Field**! Can you smell that? That delightful bouquet of noxious fumes and stagnant water? It smells like... VICTORY! Tonight, we have a match that warms the cockles of my black, withered heart. My personal favorites, the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, are hosting the visitors from the rebelliously rowdy district, **The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**!\n\nLet me tell you, folks, the conditions tonight are absolutely atrocious, which means they are **PERFECT** for Trollball! The mud is thick, the sinkholes are hungry, and the scaffolding is looking particularly lethal. The Corruptors are looking sharp—or as sharp as you can look when covered in sludge. I saw **Amedeo Bari** in the locker room earlier, polishing his boots with bacon grease. Now that is a veteran move! Not only does it keep the leather supple, but it also attracts the local vermin to distract the opposition during a scrum. That\'s the kind of tactical genius I expect from the home team!\n\nOn the other side, we have the Chaos Creatures, backed by those goody-two-shoes White Ravens. I hear **Dame Terra Monteforte** sends her regards, probably in the form of a strongly worded letter about "zoning violations." Ha! You can keep your dirt magic, Terra; down here we play in the SLIME! I watched **Boulanger Procto** trying to arrange his gear in a perfect spiral before the match. Listen, kid, five minutes into this game, your gear is going to be arranged in a pile of broken splinters and bone shards! **Fogel Raynold** has the right idea, though—I saw them slapping their own helmet until their ears rang. That—right there—is the kind of pre-concussive preparation that wins championships! So grab your popcorn, hide your valuables, and get ready for a bloodbath!\n\n',
    postGame:
      "# 🏆 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT: CORRUPTORS REIGN SUPREME! 🏆\n\n**FINAL SCORE: Ebon Gate Corruptors 2 - New Monteforte Chaos Creatures 1**\n\nSWEET MOTHER OF MAYHEM! What a game! What a spectacle! If you missed this one, you missed a masterclass in incompetence, brutality, and accidental self-mutilation! The fans at the Sinking Field got their money's worth tonight, and the healers are going to be billing overtime for the next century! Let's break down this beautiful disaster!\n\nWe picked up the action right after the half, and things immediately went off the rails. **Raouf Dragone** of the Chaos Creatures snagged the Trollball, looking to make a play. But the violence started early and often! We saw a magnificent double-knockout where **Fogel Raynold** and **Judi Carrington** just absolutely deleted each other from existence! Horseman's Pick meets Estoc, and *boom*! Both players down! That is the spirit of Trollball right there!\n\nThe healers were clearly inhaling too many of those swamp fumes tonight, folks. I saw **Terle Chenay** reviving players from the *other team* at one point! Or maybe the mud was just so thick they couldn't tell friend from foe! It was absolute anarchy! **Raouf Dragone**, still trying to be a hero, managed to spike **As Utter** into the dirt with a Trident, but couldn't connect the pass to Simsar. Blocked by **Ellette Paz**, the ball hit the mud, and the scramble was on!\n\nPossession swung to the Corruptors when **Amedeo Bari** scooped up the leather. But let's talk about the highlight of the night, shall we? **Fogel Raynold**, perhaps confused by the ringing in his ears from his pre-game ritual, managed to KNOCK HIMSELF OUT. The stats don't lie, folks! \"Fogel Raynold knocks Fogel Raynold out of play with their Horseman's Pick.\" I haven't seen that level of coordination since **Sir Artorias** tried to dance at the Fey gala! Absolutely humiliating! Absolutely hilarious!\n\nWhile the Chaos Creatures were busy beating themselves up, **Amedeo Bari** made a break for it! He ran the ball all the way into Away territory, slipping past **Wolbrom Ariella** like a greased pig at a country fair. He went for the score... he launched the ball... and... DOINK! Just short! It landed in the 2-point zone! A heartbreaking miss for the Corruptors, but it kept the drama alive!\n\nThe game dragged into **OVERTIME**! The crowd was rioting! The sinkholes were opening! **Urata Oriana** tried to make something happen for Monteforte, but **Amedeo Bari**, looking for redemption, blocked the run and popped the ball loose. It was anyone's game! The tension was thick enough to cut with a rusty jagged knife!\n\nThen, we witnessed the glorious confusion of the Corruptors! **Simsar Carrelli** picked up the ball, and his own teammate, **As Utter**, decided that was the perfect time for a duel! **FRIENDLY FIRE, FOLKS!** As Utter smashed Simsar with a Greatsword, and Simsar retaliated with a Billhook! Both Corruptors knocked each other out while the ball rolled free! I haven't seen teamwork that bad since the **Guild of the Black Sky** tried to organize a charity lunch!\n\nBut from the ashes of stupidity, a hero arose! **Napoleon Anzovin**! With bodies littered everywhere, he grabbed the loose ball in the Away 2-Point zone. **Boulanger Procto**, his spirals long forgotten, tried to block him, but Napoleon would not be denied! He smashed through the defense and SCORED THE GAME WINNER!\n\n**THE EBON GATE CORRUPTORS WIN!** The Sinking Field erupts! The mud flies! Take that, New Monteforte! Take that, Dame Terra! You can keep your orderly streets and your shiny armor; tonight, the swamp reigns supreme! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off to go find out if Fogel Raynold has regained consciousness yet. Stay evil, Osterra!",

      '# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL - LIVE FROM OSTERRA! 🎙️\n\n**Good evening, sports fans, gore-hounds, and degenerate gamblers!** This is your host, the voice of violence, the sultan of slaughter, **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE! Folks, hold your noses because we are broadcasting from the most nauseatingly sanitary place in the realm—**The Aegis Field** in Haven! Ugh, I can smell the incense and self-righteousness from the booth. It burns my sensitive nostrils! They call it "Hallowed Ground," but I call it a perfect canvas for some arterial spray!\n\nTonight, we have a clash that screams "class warfare"! In the visiting dugout, funded by the deep pockets of the **Guild of the Black Sky**, we have **The New Prosperity Profits**! I hear **Chairman Brennen Farno** actually paused counting his gold coins to wish them luck. Or maybe he was just checking his reflection in a mirror. Who knows with that guy? And facing them, the home team, the do-gooders, the team I personally hope gets turned into a fine paste... **The Haven Lights**! 🤮\n\nLet\'s look at the players warming up down there. I see **Pulchi Benyamin** for the Profits... is she... yes, folks, she is eating a dandelion. Dirt, stem, and all. That is the kind of unhinged, feral energy we love to see! Meanwhile, on the Haven side, **Dickenson Beker** is over there trying to teach a stray dog to... shake? Sit? Do long division? Beker, honey, focus on the game, or you\'re going to get flattened! \n\nThe air is crisp, the weapons are sharp, and the Healers are on standby (hopefully not too sober). It\'s time for **TROLLBALL!**',
    postGame:
      "# 🩸 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT 🩸\n\n**HAHAHA! EXTINGUISHED! SNUFFED OUT!** The Haven Lights didn't just lose tonight, folks; they were humiliated in their own backyard! The final score is a beautiful, lopsided **5 to 0** for **The New Prosperity Profits**! I haven't seen a beating this one-sided since I played cards with **Geth the Gravelord** (don't ask).\n\nThe violence started early and often! **Gladdie Farika** introduced **Shiroma Salim** to the concept of gravity with a Morning Star to the face right out of the gate. We saw bodies hitting the floor faster than **Sir Tanos** jumping to conclusions! We had a beautiful double knockout between **Krueger Jacinthe** and **Dickenson Beker**—Spear meets Billhook, everybody wins (except them)! And speaking of Krueger Jacinthe, this maniac was so blood-crazed he actually **knocked out his own teammate**, Pulchi Benyamin! That is the kind of indiscriminate malice that brings a tear to my eye. Beautiful!\n\nThe Profits' offense was led by the absolute unit **Faina Hendrix**. This guy was everywhere! First, he runs the ball, dodging **Berkin Waters** like he was dodging a sermon from **High Priestess Oona**, and BAM! Shoots from the field for **2 points**! Later in the game, he intercepts a pass intended for Wieren Ivar and drills *another* **2-point** shot! Faina, if you ever want to switch to the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, call me!\n\nMeanwhile, the Haven Lights couldn't hit the broad side of a barn! **Berkin Waters**, **Shiroma Salim**, **Zwart Bunns**—they all tossed the Trollball into the dirt like it was a cursed artifact. Pathetic! **Coward Tarton** tried to salvage some dignity at the end, but true to the name, missed the mark completely!\n\nThe Profits sealed the deal when **Yoshi Cathy** went on a tear, running through the entire Haven defense. **Marlane Lounge** tried to stop him, but Yoshi laughed in the face of danger and slammed that leather head home for a **Touchdown**! \n\nSo, to the **Temple of Light**, to the **Shield**, and to all you heroes thinking your \"Twinlight's Glow\" would save you: **LOOK UPON THE SCOREBOARD AND DESPAIR!** The Guild's money might be dirty, but their victory is crystal clear! \n\nThis is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off. Remember: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how many bones you break along the way! Goodnight, Osterra!",

      "# 🎙️ WELCOME TO FLETCHINGS FIELD, FOLKS! 🎙️\n\nGreetings, heathens, gore-hounds, and sports fans from every plane of existence! This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live for another electrifying edition of **TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL!** We are broadcasting from the lovely Fletchings Field in Fletchings, a stadium that balances wood, stone, and the delightful promise of splinters! The local druids have shifted the terrain, probably to hide the bodies later, and the atmosphere is absolutely electric with the scent of impending violence! 🩸🌳\n\nTonight, we have a delicious fratricidal match-up! It’s a Warden civil war as **The Greenwatch** travel to face their brethren in **Oak & Onslaught**! Oh, I simply *love* it when the \"good guys\" beat each other senseless. Sir Randy with his FANCY bow and Falric the coin-counter must be sweating in their boots watching their precious protectors square off! Will they hug it out? NO! They’re going to smash each other with kirkhammers! 🏹💰\n\nLet's look at the locker room insanity! **Madea Mensch** of The Greenwatch is currently tying his bootlaces together and hopping around... is this a tactical handicap or just stupidity? I love it! Meanwhile, **Wynnie Faina** for the home team is wearing his boots on the wrong feet! It's a battle of podiatric terrible decisions! And listen to that—**Milt Casady** is leading Oak & Onslaught in a chant that’s getting louder and louder! It sounds like a war cry, or perhaps a menu order! Who cares! Grab your popcorn and hide your kids, because it’s time for **TROLLBAAAALLL!** 👹🏈",

      "# 🩸 THE GREENWATCH OUTLAST THE ONSLAUGHT! 🩸\n\nWhat a spectacle! What a massacre! The dust has settled at Fletchings Field, and the **Greenwatch** have emerged victorious over **Oak & Onslaught** with a final score of **3 to 2**! It was a close one, folks, tighter than Governor-King Zenku's mask, but the visitors managed to claw their way to victory through a haze of bruises and broken dreams! Let’s break down the carnage! 🦴\n\nThe game started with **Goldenberg Rimola** of the Greenwatch acting like a possessed gazelle, snatching that leather troll head and sprinting into enemy territory! But the violence started early! **Ema Ulrick**, wielding a Cutlass like a butcher late for a shift, absolutely flattened Rese Halpern! A beautiful start to the hostilities! \n\nThe Greenwatch didn’t let the blood loss slow them down, though. **Troy Jorgan**, who I’m told takes advice from the ball itself—maybe it told him to duck?—slipped past the defense and launched a massive shot from the 2-point zone! **GOAL!** Two points for the Greenwatch right out of the gate! But the celebration was cut short immediately! 💥\n\nIn a display of pure spite—my favorite emotion—**Wynnie Faina** of Oak & Onslaught marched up to the scorer, Troy Jorgan, and smashed him out of play with a Mace! You score on us? We break your ribs! That’s the Trollball spirit! The Healers were working overtime in the first half, folks. Ahron Latashia and Nariko Javed were practically running laps dragging bodies back onto the field! 🚑\n\nThen, we saw the highlight of the half! A **DOUBLE KNOCKOUT!** Abner Seidel and Troy Jorgan clashed in the center, Talwar meeting Kirkhammer, and BOTH went down in a heap! Neither man standing! It was poetic! It was beautiful! It was exactly what I pay to see! The half ended with the Greenwatch up 2-0, and the crowd thirsting for more! ⚔️\n\nComing out of Halftime, **Nobe Haukom** decided he hadn’t hurt enough people yet. He picked up the ball and immediately introduced **Symer Crissy** to the business end of a Mallet! WHACK! With the path cleared, he launched a pass to **Madea Mensch**, who hopped his way past Milt Casady and walked it in for a **TOUCHDOWN!** That put the Greenwatch up 3-0! 🦶\n\nBut Oak & Onslaught weren't dead yet! Or, well, they were brought back to life by their healer, so they literally weren't dead! **Symer Crissy**, fresh off the revival bench, decided to write her own hero story. After a frantic scramble and some brutal fighting involving Goldenberg Rimola crushing Normi Glaudia, Crissy found herself with the ball in the 2-point zone. She launched it... and **SCORED!** Two points for the home team! The gap narrowed to 3-2! 📈\n\nThe tension was palpable! Oak & Onslaught had the momentum! Symer Crissy tried to connect with Milt Casady, but the Greenwatch defense was too thick! And then, the chaos reached its peak. **Wynnie Faina** and **Darin Berliner** collided in a shower of sparks and violence—another **DOUBLE KNOCKOUT!** A Mace to the face and a Bardiche to the... well, everywhere! Both players hit the dirt! 💀💀\n\nIn the final moments, **Darin Berliner**, miraculously returned to the field by Nariko Javed, snatched the ball in the away zone. With seconds ticking down, Wynnie Faina tried to stop her, but Darin slipped through like a greasy eel! She held onto possession as time expired! \n\nAnd that's the game! **The Greenwatch wins 3-2!** A valiant effort by Oak & Onslaught, but they just couldn't stop the bleeding—literally! I bet Sir Randy is crying into his herbal tea right now, while Falric tries to calculate the deductibles on all those injuries! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off and reminding you: If you can't win, make sure the other guy can't walk! Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙👹",

      "🎙️ **GOOD EVENING, OSTERRA!** 🎙️\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting LIVE from the dizzying heights of **The High-Pass Pitch** at Oread's Summit! Folks, the air is thin up here, but the tension is THICK enough to cut with a rusted cleaver! We’ve got a Week 2 spectacle that promises bruises, broken bones, and beautiful brutality! Tonight, the **Kerlauger Runeguard** have marched their way up the mountain to face the **Oread's Summit Tamers**! 🏔️⚔️\n\nThe Tamers are playing in their home clouds, backed by the **Prismatic Troupes**. You know, that circus led by Kython? I usually prefer my entertainment involves screaming rather than juggling, but on the Trollball pitch, hopefully, we get both! Their player **Alwyn Wandy** was seen whispering a secret fear to the ball earlier. Spooky! Or maybe just pathetic? We'll see! Meanwhile, **Odericus Juxon** has been slapping their own helmet until their ears ring. Now THAT is the kind of brain damage I like to see *before* the whistle blows! 🤡🎪\n\nAnd let's not forget our visitors, the Runeguard! They fly the banner of the **White Ravens**. Ah, yes, Colm's bunch. The man with the handshake of a wet fish and the luck of a black cat under a ladder. But their players are tough! **Lashondra Niehaus** warms up by getting punched in the shoulder, and **Harilda Sigsmond** has the whole team chanting like a cult! I love a good cult! 😈\n\nCan the Runeguard overcome the altitude and the vertigo? Will the Tamers put on a show or just get shown the door? Grab your popcorn and your bandages, folks, because it's **TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL!** Let the mayhem begin! 🩸🏈",

      "🏁 **GAME OVER! AND WHAT A SCRAP IT WAS!** 🏁\n\nKeep your healers on speed dial, folks, because the body count was high tonight! The **Kerlauger Runeguard** have scraped out a victory against the **Oread's Summit Tamers** with a final score of **3 to 2**! It was messy, it was chaotic, and it was absolutely DELIGHTFUL! 💀✨\n\nThe violence started immediately! **Lorilee Aldred** of the Runeguard introduced **Clippard Burr** to the floor with a Katar swipe that I felt in my own horns! But the real highlight of the first half was the rivalry between **Benjie Foulk** and **Mitran Mariand**. These two just couldn't stand each other! A beautiful double-knockout sent them both to the dirt early on! 👊💥 While the bodies were hitting the floor, **Johnna Beetner** slipped through the chaos, dancing past Swamy Ahasuerus to score a TOUCHDOWN for Kerlauger! **1-0 Runeguard!**\n\nThe first half ended with **Harilda Sigsmond** and **Zadoc Wyatan** trading blows until neither was left standing. A double knockout to end the half? That's poetry! 📜🩸\n\nAfter the break, things got WEIRD. **Shepperd Trefler** tried to make a play for the Runeguard but threw the ball right into the hands of the Tamer's **Zadoc Wyatan**! An interception! But wait! **Lashondra Niehaus** wasn't having any of that hero nonsense. She stripped the ball right back from Zadoc and launched a massive SHOOT from distance! **BAM! 2 POINTS!** The Runeguard go up **3-0**! What a swing! 🔄🚀\n\nBut the Tamers weren't dead yet! **Swamy Ahasuerus** caught a pass from a revived Mitran and answered back with a 2-point shot of their own! **3-2!** The tension was palpable! 😱\n\nThe final minutes were a desperate scramble. Lashondra tried to put it away but fell short. Alwyn Wandy tried to tie it up but couldn't get the distance! And just for old time's sake, **Benjie Foulk** and **Mitran Mariand** knocked each other out AGAIN! I think those two need to get a room or a duel to the death! 😂\n\nIn the end, the White Ravens' squad held on! Take that, Kython! Your circus acts couldn't juggle their way out of this beating! The **Kerlauger Runeguard** take the win! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off and reminding you: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how much blood you spill along the way!

      "# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL: YETIS VS. NARWHALS 🎙️\n\nGood evening, sports fans, demon spawn, and mortal meat-sacks alike! Nok the Corrupter here, broadcasting LIVE from the perilously windy **Cliffside Pitch** in Southport! The air is salty, the drop is deadly, and the violence? Oh, folks, it promises to be absolutely *delightful*! 😈 We’ve got a clash of the climates tonight as the freezing **South Pole Yetis** trek north to face the gale-force fury of the **Southport Narwhals**!\n\nLet’s look at the visitors from the frozen wastes, the Yetis! They’re backed by the folks at Cedar Hill—Imra and Elspeth Ortell. Let’s hope Elspeth sent them with some of that *Disintegrate* magic, because they’re going to need it against this wind! I caught a glimpse of **Udela Dorkus** in the locker room, and folks, she was *licking a whetstone*! 👅🪨 Now that is the kind of iron-deficiency-induced rage I like to see! And their healer, **Seiter Aida**, was smelling the team's dirty socks from last week. Disgusting? Yes. Effective? We shall see!\n\nAnd for the home team, the Narwhals! This rough-and-tumble crew represents Grimfrost, home of King Nezmear and his... *beloved* livestock. 🐄 I watched **Blood Eppes** earlier; he spent exactly seven minutes stretching his hamstrings. Precision, folks! That’s how you prepare to sever arteries! And keep an eye on **Loralyn Lyndy**—she was making quite a show of adjusting her codpiece with theatrical importance. Vanity and violence, a match made in the lower planes! \n\nThe wind is howling, the weapons are sharp, and the healers are trembling! Pour yourself a glass of something toxic, sit back, and let’s watch some bones SNAP! PLAY BALL! 🩸🏈",

      "# 🏁 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT 🏁\n\n**FINAL SCORE: Southport Narwhals 4 - South Pole Yetis 3**\n\nHot diggity demon, what a spectacle! 🌟 If you blinked, you probably missed a limb flying into the stands! This game had everything: strategic shooting, fumbled balls, and enough mutual destruction to make a War God blush! The Narwhals manage to defend the Cliffside Pitch, sending the Yetis back to the ice with nothing but bruises and frostbite!\n\n The action started hot with **Sale Tocci** of the Yetis. After stuffing a run by Torey Dannye, Tocci took that leather head and launched a beautiful shot from Center Field! **BOOM!** 2 points for the visitors right out of the gate! 🧊 But the violence? Oh, it was just getting started. **Braden Gaile** introduced Isborne Krause to the floor with a nasty Swordstaff strike. That’s the way we like it!\n\nThen, the chaos set in! Loralyn Lyndy started moving the ball, but the field turned into a slaughterhouse. We saw a **DOUBLE KNOCKOUT** between Sale Tocci and Braden Gaile! Bodies hitting the floor in perfect synchronization! 💀💀 And if that wasn't enough, Coussoule Bidle and Torey Dannye did the exact same tango—smashing each other into oblivion simultaneously! With the field cleared by sheer brutality, **Loralyn Lyndy** stepped up and rifled a shot from the Away 2-Point zone to tie the game! **2-2!**\n\nThe middle of this match was an absolute meat grinder. I haven't seen this much blood since the last time I visited the Demon Prison cafeteria! 🩸 We had **FOUR** separate instances of players knocking each other out at the same time! Duky Orelee and Blood Eppes traded blows until neither could stand. Coussoule Bidle—who was an absolute terror today—traded consciousness with Blanc Fantasia. The healers, Sand Denys and Seiter Aida, were working harder than Imra trying to collect on a bar tab at Cedar Hill! 🍻\n\nComing out of halftime, the gridlock continued. **Selima Si** finally broke the stalemate for the Yetis, catching a pass from Udela Dorkus and running it in for a TOUCHDOWN! That put the South Pole up 3-2, and things looked grim for the Narwhals. King Nezmear must have been pacing nervously in his castle, worrying about his betting pool!\n\nBut folks, you can never count out a team with a precarious lighthouse on their field! In the dying moments of the game, with bodies littering the turf, **Loralyn Lyndy** became the MVP. She picked up a loose ball in Center Field, dodged a murder-attempt by Coussoule Bidle (who slipped right past her!), and ran into the Away Field. Instead of risking a tackle, she pulled up and **SANK THE SHOT!** 🏹🎯 Two points for Southport!\n\nThat 2-point bomber put the Narwhals up 4-3, and the whistle blew before the Yetis could recover! A heartbreaking loss for the visitors, but a glorious day for violence enthusiasts everywhere! 🤕\n\nLoralyn Lyndy is the star of the show, scoring all 4 points for her team, but the real winner is the concept of head trauma! The heroes of the realm might preach peace, but out here on the pitch, the only truth is steel meeting skull! Until next week, keep your weapons sharp and your healers on speed dial! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! 😈📻",

      "# 🎙️ GOOD EVENING, BLOODSPORTS FANS! 🎙️\n\nIt's a beautiful, blindingly bright Tuesday night here in Osterra, and this is **Nok the Corrupter** coming to you live from the **Buccaneer's Bowl**! 🏴‍☠️ We are at the Toast Island Resort, folks, and let me tell you, the smell of sea salt is almost strong enough to cover the stench of the impending violence! The tourists are distracted, the security is tight, and the sun is beating down on the field like a hammer on an anvil! It is a perfect day for TROLLBALL! 👹🏈\n\nTonight, we have a clash of cultures! Traveling down from the stone ramparts of the Stronghold, we have the **New Ravenfall Commanders**! 🏰 They are looking disciplined, they are looking heavily armored, and they are looking to smash! I've been watching their warm-ups, and **Jozef Pepe** is already in mid-season form—I heard him belching from the commentary booth! That is the sound of a warrior prepared for war! Of course, they are associated with the Eponore faction. You know, folks like **God King Sir Artorias**? I bet Artorias is too busy signing autographs to watch this match. Typical celebrity behavior! 🙄\n\nAnd facing them, on their home turf, the **Tortell Privateers**! 🏝️ These Cedar Hill scoundrels are ready to defend their beach! I saw **Dib Tufts** chugging raw eggs—shells and all—right before taking the field. That is the kind of psychopathic dedication I respect! They've got the backing of **Elspeth Ortell**, the disintegration dealer herself. Let's hope she didn't accidentally disintegrate the game plan, eh? Ha! 🧪\n\nThe leather is tough, the weapons are sharp, and my heart is black with anticipation! Let's get down to the violence! 🩸⚔️",

      "# 🏁 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT 🏁\n\n**FINAL SCORE: Tortell Privateers 4 - New Ravenfall Commanders 2**\n\nWow! What a display! What a magnificent, messy, beautiful display of aggression! The **Tortell Privateers** have defended their sandy fortress and sent the Commanders packing back to their castle with nothing but bruises and a loss! 🏆\n\nThe match started with absolute chaos, just the way I like it! **Castorina Gies** was everywhere early on for the Privateers, scooping up that Troll head and running like a thief in the night! But the real highlight? The sheer number of double-knockouts! 💥 We had **Theis Loredo** and **Keisling Damalas** knocking each other into next week almost immediately! It is a beautiful thing when nobody wins a fight! Mutual destruction is the purest form of combat!\n\nThe Privateers drew first blood on the scoreboard, though! **Castorina Gies** found a lane and fired a shot from Away Field—BAM! Two points! 🎯 The Commanders looked stunned. They were reeling! And before they could recover, **Ellan Elburt** launched another shot from Center Field to make it **4-0**! The Commanders' defense was looking about as useful as **Governor-King Zenku**'s face cream! \n\nWe saw some classic brutality in the trenches. **Dusa Curson** and **Loralee Sunny**? Both unconscious! **Goldberg Tova** and **Fleme Alis**? Both counting sheep! 💤 The healers, **Hooge Imtiaz** and **Eugen Zacks**, were the hardest working people on the pitch today! They were patching up limbs faster than **Sir Garon Ironrock** opens doors!\n\nHalftime came and went, and the Commanders finally woke up! 🔔 In the second half, **Croteau Osmo** managed to slip through the defense and fire a rocket from Home Field to put Ravenfall on the board! **4-2**! I thought we were in for a comeback! I was ready to see the Privateers crumble like a stale cookie!\n\nBut oh, the fumble-fest that followed! 🤣 It was a comedy of errors! **Loralee Sunny** dropped it. **Rhett Gavrilla** dropped it. **Dusa Curson** missed a shot and dropped it. It was slippery out there! Maybe **Imra** spilled some of his \"elixirs\" on the ball? It was chaos! Absolute butterfingers all around!\n\nIn the end, the Privateers held on. **Dib Tufts** made a crucial steal, and **Castorina Gies** controlled the clock as the time ticked down. The Commanders fought hard—**Jozef Pepe** absolutely flattened **Kidder Starkey** with that Zweihander—but it wasn't enough to close the gap.\n\nSo, the **Tortell Privateers** take the win! The Commanders go home to cry on **Morgwae's** shoulder. A fantastic night of broken bones and shattered dreams! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, reminding you to keep your head up, or someone will knock it off! Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙😈",

      "Helloooooo Trollball fanatics, and welcome back to Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the ethereal airwaves! We have a real scorcher for you tonight, folks, a battle that’s going to make the very ground shake! In one corner, hailing from the sweltering Sun-Baked Bowl, we have The Desert Spectres! And in the other, crawling from the sulfurous stink of the Su'akour Ruins, it’s The Brimstone Fire Eaters!\n\nNow, these aren't your clean-cut, goody-two-shoes adventurers from Eponore, oh no! These are warriors, titans of the turf! The Spectres are getting ready by engaging in some truly inspired rituals. I'm seeing Angelita Darce out there shaving exactly one half of his mustache for the game—that’s the kind of dedication that wins championships, my friends! And their healer, Verlee Dacia, is sweetening the deal by eating a piece of honeycomb. Let's hope that victory tastes just as sweet!\n\nBut don't you count out the home team! The Brimstone Fire Eaters live and breathe this gritty game! Just look at Glassman Solley, forgoing soap and water to wash their hands with the very dirt of the arena! And Bollinger Susette is warming up by having a teammate punch him square in the shoulder! You won't see Sir Artorias doing *that* before a big battle, I can tell you!\n\nThe air here is thick with anticipation and, in Brimstone's case, noxious fumes! The stage is set for a symphony of shattered bones and spectacular scores! Who will emerge from the dust and smoke victorious? We're about to find out! So grab your grog, place your bets with anyone *but* Yarp, and get ready for the most beautiful violence in all of Osterra! It's Trollball time!",
    postGame:
      "AND THAT'S THE GAME, FOLKS! What a spectacle! What a showdown! The Brimstone Fire Eaters have doused the desert flames, taking the win with a final score of 3 to 1! An absolutely electrifying performance here in the Su'akour Bowl!\n\nThe action started fast and furious right from the get-go! The ball was barely in play before Oona Jane of the Fire Eaters decided Lovash Marius had seen enough of the field for a while, sending them to the dirt with a mighty swing of their cudgel! That's how you set the tone, my friends!\n\nThe Desert Spectres tried to answer back, with Huesman Ring launching a prayer from center field, but it fell short. The ball then became a hot potato in the Fire Eaters' zone, a beautiful, chaotic scramble of fumbles, blocks, and stolen possessions. This is the heart of Trollball, a glorious mess that no battlefield commander could ever choreograph!\n\nBut the Spectres weren't just going to roll over! Heyes Iver brought out the big chopper, knocking Campball Fink out of the game with a Woodsman's Axe! In the ensuing chaos, Fidellia Mozelle scooped up the troll head and barrelled past the opposition for the first score of the night! A touchdown for the Spectres!\n\nAt halftime, the score was a nail-biting 1-0 in favor of the visitors. Both teams retreated to lick their wounds, and the healers, bless their souls, worked overtime to get everyone back on their feet for the second round of glorious brutality.\n\nAnd what a second half it was! The Brimstone Fire Eaters came out breathing, well, fire! Lowson Hersh put the team on their back, grabbing the ball and starting a determined march up the field.\n\nThe crunching tackles came thick and fast! We had a spectacular double knockout as Huesman Ring and Wylde Jutta traded blows and sent each other packing! You see that, Dame Terra? That's how you move the earth! A truly inspiring moment of mutual destruction!\n\nUndeterred by the carnage, Lowson Hersh continued their advance and, finding an opening, launched a perfect shot from the away field! It sailed through the goal for TWO BIG POINTS! The Fire Eaters took the lead, and the hometown crowd went absolutely wild!\n\nThe rest of the match was a blur of beautiful violence! We had more double KOs than a tavern brawl on payday! Bahr Ethelstan and Oona Jane took each other out! Muscolo Jaehne and Bollinger Susette followed suit! Then Steve and Selimah Tully decided to join the party! The healers were earning their pay tonight, folks! It was a meat grinder out there, the kind of recycling even Cyfnerth would approve of!\n\nAnd through it all, who emerged from the pile of bodies with the ball? None other than the hero of the half, Lowson Hersh! They dodged one last defender and plunged into the end zone for another score, sealing the victory for the Brimstone Fire Eaters! What a performance! An absolute masterclass in Trollball tenacity!\n\nSo let the record show, here on this glorious Tuesday night, The Brimstone Fire Eaters stand tall with a 3-to-1 victory over the Desert Spectres! A game full of grit, guts, and glorious, glorious violence! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! See you next time, you beautiful brutes!",

      "Helloooooo sports fans, and welcome to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolutely blinding Glowstone Terrace here in Confluence! My eyes! This place is certainly... polished. A far cry from the good, honest muck of the Ebon Gate pits, but the action promises to be just as dirty!\n\nTonight, we have a real treat for you as the hometown heroes, The Confluence Captains, take on the visiting New Ravenfall Commanders! The air is electric, the mountain wind is howling, and the market crowd down below is making a terrific racket! The Captains are looking... interesting in their warm-ups. Ladew Evelina is chugging raw eggs, shell and all! Now that's how you prepare for battle! Meanwhile, O'Conner Maighdlin is speaking only in rhymes, which I'm sure is just delightful for his teammates.\n\nThe visiting Commanders don't look like they're here for a poetry slam, folks! I see Theis Loredo and Pirozzo Opal sharing a bit of fermented fish—a bold move that's sure to keep defenders at a distance! And you have to love the sheer power of Jozef Pepe's pre-game ritual: a belching contest! That's the kind of team-building you just don't see from those stuffy Guild types like Chairman Farno. This promises to be a clash of styles, a battle of brute force against... well, slightly different brute force! It's going to be a beautiful, beautiful mess! Don't you dare touch that dial!",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! WHAT A FINISH! When the dust settled and the last body hit the gleaming stone of this ridiculous pitch, your New Ravenfall Commanders walk away with the victory, shutting out the hometown Captains TWO to NOTHING!\n\nA scoreless first half had us all wondering if these two teams were just going to dance around all night, but boy, did they prove old Nok wrong! It was a real defensive slobberknocker in that first half. We saw players on both sides taken out in spectacular fashion! Fleme Alis and Vonni Geoff went down together in a beautiful symphony of violence right at the start! Not to be outdone, Behl Berstine and Croteau Osmo decided to take a mutual trip to the healers' tent as well!\n\nThe ball was like a greased goblin out there, slipping through fingers and fumbling on the slick glowstone. Both teams had their chances, with Rhett Gavrilla and Carnahan Laud letting potential scoring shots fall short. It was a grinder, a real testament to the defensive might of these squads.\n\nThen came the second half, and everything changed! The whistle blew, and Dusa Curson of the Commanders came out with fire in her eyes! She scooped up the Trollball and, after a beautiful knockout from her teammate Estes Adrian, she made a break for it!\n\nShe weaved through the chaos, dodging would-be tacklers and ignoring the fresh carnage as Fleme Alis and Carnahan Laud decided to knock each other out of the game for a second time! With a mighty heave, Dusa Curson launched the Trollball from the 2-point zone... AND IT'S GOOD! A magnificent shot that put the Commanders on the board, 2-0!\n\nThat, my friends, is when the game truly descended into the glorious mayhem we all crave! The Confluence Captains, desperate to score, started throwing bodies around with reckless abandon. And the Commanders were more than happy to answer in kind!\n\nIt was a cascade of pure, unadulterated Trollball! Ladew Evelina knocked out Pirozzo Opal! Vonni Geoff and Estes Adrian took each other out! Behl Berstine laid out Jessalin Zobias! Deach Sharlene flattened Croteau Osmo!\n\nFleme Alis, having returned from his nap, decided he wasn't done and proceeded to knock out Stephan Lisk AND Richia Pazit! What a performance from that young man! The field was littered with bodies, and the healers were working overtime!\n\nIn the final moments, the Captains' star player, Ladew Evelina, made one last desperate push. She had the ball, she had a path, but she was met by a wall of granite named Theis Loredo! The block was perfect, the ball came loose, and that was all she wrote!\n\nA hard-fought, bone-crunching victory for The New Ravenfall Commanders! I'm sure their patron, Sir Tanos, is smiling somewhere. As for the Captains, well, maybe their Guild chairmen should spend less time admiring doors and more time teaching their players how to hold onto a ball! What a night! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!",

      "## 🔥 Tuesday Night Trollball is BACK! 🔥\n\nHello, fight fans, and welcome back to another glorious evening of TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! This is your favorite host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolute best stadium in all of Osterra, the magnificent Sinking Field in Ebon Gate! The noxious fumes are thick, the mud is extra soupy, and there's a rumor of a new sinkhole opening right in the center field. It's a perfect night for some real sport!\n\nTonight, my mighty, my magnificent, my **Ebon Gate Corruptors** are kicking off their season against some visitors from the swamp, The Zmeigorod Snessengers! Now, I've seen these Snessengers getting ready, and what a peculiar bunch! You've got Delija Dowling over there chugging raw eggs, shell and all! And Evalyn Pierrepont is polishing his helmet with a live snail! A SNAIL! I suppose when you live in a bog ruled by the so-called 'Bog Queen' Valos, you pick up some strange habits. Let's see if those slimy rituals help them navigate our beautiful, treacherous mud!\n\nBut let's talk about the real stars of the show! The Ebon Gate Corruptors are looking FIERCE tonight! I saw Smith Syst daring a teammate to eat a live worm for luck—now that's team spirit! And As Utter is looking focused, insisting on being the last one out of the locker room. That's the kind of dedication you don't see from those goody-two-shoes adventurers like Sir Artorias. The Corruptors are ready to bring the pain, and I for one can't wait to see them turn the field into a masterpiece of glorious destruction. Grab your grog, folks, because the whistle is about to blow, and the carnage is about to begin!",
    postGame:
      "### A Shocking Upset at The Sinking Field!\n\nWell, folks, I am beside myself. In a game that was wall-to-wall action from the opening whistle to the last, the visiting Zmeigorod Snessengers have pulled off an upset here in Ebon Gate. It was a slugfest, a real donnybrook, but the scoreboard tells a tale that is bitter to this old demon's heart.\n\n### First Half Frenzy\n\nThe action started immediately! The Snessengers got the ball, and Northway Orran came out swinging that Machete, knocking my Corruptors' own Simsar Carrelli right out of play! Not to be outdone, Dare Wynnie laid out Ellette Paz with a Quarterstaff! A brutal opening statement from the visitors.\n\nNorthway Orran then made a spectacular run, slipping past Amedeo Bari, but couldn't stick the landing for the score! The ball was loose, a prime opportunity! But that's when my man, the great As Utter, a warrior who would make Cyfnerth the Butcher proud, stepped up and flattened Dare Wynnie with his Greatsword! WHAT A HIT!\n\nPossession was a slippery thing tonight. The Corruptors' own Smith Syst scooped up the ball and, after a tense moment, zipped a perfect pass to Napoleon Anzovin! Anzovin made a great run but, like his Snessenger counterpart, just couldn't find the basket. The tension was palpable, ladies and gentlemen!\n\nThe Snessengers mounted another charge, with Evalyn Pierrepont and Kleinstein MacGregor connecting on a beautiful play to move deep into Corruptors territory. The violence was non-stop! Players were dropping like flies, with KOs traded back and forth in a beautiful, chaotic dance! It was everything you want in this wonderful sport!\n\nWhen the halftime whistle blew, the score was still knotted at zero, but the field was littered with bruised bodies and broken pride. A true stalemate of brutality!\n\n### The Decisive Second Half\n\nThe second half began with even more chaos! We had a spectacular double KO, with Ahasuerus An and Dare Wynnie taking each other down in a blaze of glory! You simply love to see that kind of mutual destruction!\n\nMy Corruptors looked poised to strike when Ellette Paz grabbed the ball, but a crucial block by Kleinstein MacGregor led to a turnover! A heartbreaker! MacGregor was then stopped cold by Bullion Iglesias, and the ball was loose once more!\n\nAnd then... it happened. Amidst the chaos of battle, with players locked in desperate combat all over the field, the Snessengers' Gere Cordelie got her hands on the Trollball in our home field. She looked up, she took a breath, and she let it fly.\n\nThe ball sailed through the swampy air, a perfect arc, and went straight through the hoop. A two-point shot for The Zmeigorod Snessengers. The crowd was stunned into silence. A lucky, infuriatingly perfect shot.\n\nThe Corruptors fought valiantly to the very end, but they just couldn't answer back. The final whistle blew on a scene of Snessenger celebration.\n\n### Final Score\n\nSo there you have it, folks. Your final score from The Sinking Field:\n\n*   **The Zmeigorod Snessengers: 2**\n*   **The Ebon Gate Corruptors: 0**\n\nA tough loss for the home team, but what a spectacular display of violence and mayhem! My Corruptors may have lost on the scoreboard, but they won in our hearts with their sheer ferocity. They'll be back, you can count on it! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!",

      "Helloooooo Trollball fanatics, and welcome to another spectacular edition of **Tuesday Night Trollball**! This is your favorite demonic announcer, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the most painfully pristine stadium in all of Osterra, The Aegis Field! 🏟️ Yes, folks, we're deep in Haven territory, where the grass is a little too green and the air is a little too clean for my liking. But don't you worry, because we've got a matchup tonight that's guaranteed to stain this 'Hallowed Ground' with a bit of good, honest brutality!\n\nIn the home corner, we have the ever-pious, the ever-shining, **The Haven Lights**! 😇 I've heard their pre-game rituals involve things like drinking lukewarm water and whispering their fears to the Trollball itself. It's a novel strategy, I'll give them that. Perhaps they're hoping to bore the opposition into submission! Let's see if their prayers to the Twin Lights will be enough to protect them from what's coming.\n\nAnd what's coming, you ask? Why, it's the challengers from the deep woods, the hard-hitting, the awe-inspiring **Wyrmwood Stronghammers**! 🔨 Now this is a team that knows how to get ready for a game! While the Lights are drawing diagrams, Stronghammer players like Autumn Jodoin are chugging raw eggs, shell and all! Sondra Elaina is polishing her boots with bacon grease! That, my friends, is the smell of impending victory! They've emerged from their Hollow Mine ready to prove that a little grit and grime beats prayers and polish every single time!\n\nSo grab your grog, place your bets with anyone who isn't Yarp, and settle in! The pitch is ready, the players are hungry, and the Trollball is practically humming with the promise of glorious violence! It's the righteous versus the rugged, the sacred versus the strong! This is going to be one for the ages! Let's get ready to TROLLBALLLLL! 💥",
    postGame:
      "### What a Game, Folks! A Defensive Duel to the End!\n\nAnd that's the final whistle, ladies and demons! A hard-fought, bone-crunching slugfest here at the Aegis Field has come to a close, and it's the visiting team who leaves with their heads held high! Your final score: **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers: 1, The Haven Lights: 0**! A shutout victory on enemy turf! You absolutely love to see it!\n\n### First Half Fury!\n\nThe first half was a masterclass in chaos! The Lights came out swinging, with Coward Tarton grabbing the ball early, but a fumbled pass set the tone for their offense all night. The first real statement was made by Haven's Marlane Lounge, who sent Rebane Kendy to the sidelines with a nasty shot from their Main-gauche! That's the beautiful game right there!\n\nBut the Stronghammers answered right back! A fantastic block by Cornela Piscatelli turned the tables, and the brawl was on! We saw bodies hit the floor left and right! Ultun Barthelemy took out Riffle Heyde with his Partisan! Godart Urissa sent Wieren Ivar packing with a Cestus! It was a beautiful, rotating door of pain, and the healers, Hamburger Marthe and Riffle Harrington, were working harder than Sir Garon Ironrock at a door convention!\n\nWe even had a spectacular double-knockout, as Odelia Abbott's whip and Tybi Reo's mace connected simultaneously, sending both warriors to the dirt! A perfect symphony of destruction! Not to be outdone, Cornela Piscatelli and Farand Keil decided to take a nap together after a vicious exchange. This is what Trollball is all about, folks!\n\nThen came the moment that decided it all. After a wild scramble and a teammate-on-teammate KO that was truly something to behold, Sabian Gleason made a powerful run, pushing deep into Haven territory. The ball found its way to Calvinna Isador, who dodged a block from Shiroma Salim and plunged into the end zone for a TOUCHDOWN! scored 1 point for The Wyrmwood Stronghammers! An absolutely stunning play that put the Stronghammers on the board!\n\n### Halftime Lull\n\nThe teams took a much-needed break to stitch up their wounds and plot their next moves. All KO'd players were returned to the field, fresh and ready for more glorious combat. You could feel the tension in the air, thick enough to cut with a Kriegsmesser.\n\n### Second Half Slugfest\n\nThe second half kicked off with even more violence! We had TWO double-KOs right out of the gate, as players from both sides decided to take each other out of the equation. The aggression was palpable! The Lights knew they had to score, and Dickenson Beker tried to lead the charge, but was stuffed by a brilliant block from Odelia Abbott.\n\nThe star of the second half, however, was Sondra Elaina for the Stronghammers! She scooped up the loose ball and made a magnificent run, tearing through the Haven defense like Cyfnerth through a buffet line. She looked for a pass, but the Lights' defense, for all their offensive failings, managed to hold her up. She was eventually blocked, and Haven took over.\n\nBut what did the Lights do with their chance? Riffle Heyde heaved a pass to Tybi Reo... who promptly fumbled it! Oh, the agony! Dropping the ball at a crucial moment like that is a mistake not even Sir Artorias could talk his way out of. That pristine 'Hallowed Ground' must be mighty slippery!\n\nIn a stunning display of déjà vu, Sondra Elaina picked up the loose ball *again* and made the *exact same run*, breaking through the line and deep into Haven territory! It was poetry in motion! But alas, she was blocked once more, and the ball was loose on the field as the final whistle blew.\n\n### A Stronghammer Statement!\n\nAnd so, the Wyrmwood Stronghammers secure a magnificent 1-0 victory! They came into the home of the pious, weathered the storm, and walked away with the win, all thanks to that single, beautiful touchdown in the first half. The Haven Lights fought hard, but their offense just couldn't find a rhythm, fumbling away their best chances. Maybe they should spend less time chewing on roots and more time practicing catching the ball!\n\nWhat a night! What a game! Until next time, this has been Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that a broken bone is just a souvenir from a game well played! Goodnight, everybody! 😈",

      "Hello, Trollball fanatics, and welcome to another glorious Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting live from the delightfully chaotic Unruly Yard in New Monteforte! The air is thick with the smell of cheap ale and impending violence, just the way I like it! 🏟️\n\nTonight, we've got a real barn-burner for you as the hometown heroes, The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures, take on the visiting stalwarts, The Kerlauger Runeguard! Both of these teams fall under the watchful eye of the White Ravens, so you know this is going to be a family squabble of the best kind—the kind with spiked gauntlets and battle axes! Maybe Dame Terra Monteforte taught them a few tricks for rearranging the dirt... with their opponents' faces!\n\nDown on the field, the players are getting ready in their own special ways. For the Runeguard, I see Lashondra Niehaus getting a good, solid punch to the shoulder to wake her up, while Vivia Namara is slapping her own face after spitting in her hand! Now that's how you prepare for battle! You won't see Sir Artorias doing that before he goes off to bother some poor, misunderstood monster.\n\nAnd for the hometown Chaos Creatures, Alben Diantha is plunging his hands into ice-cold water—perfect for keeping a cool head when you're caving in someone else's! And Placido Kora is over there telling a joke to the Trollball itself! Let's hope it's a killer joke, folks, because we are just moments away from the opening whistle! Get ready for the mayhem!",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! WHAT A GAME! If that didn't get your blood pumping, you might want to check if you still have any! Your ol' pal Nok is still buzzing from that finish! An overtime thriller that went right down to the wire!\n\n### Final Score:\n*   **The Kerlauger Runeguard: 3**\n*   **The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures: 2**\n\nThe visiting Runeguard steals one in the Unruly Yard! The home crowd is absolutely furious, and it is BEAUTIFUL! 💥\n\nThis whole contest was a see-saw of glorious brutality from the second half onward! We saw bodies hitting the floor immediately, with Lorilee Aldred sending Raouf Dragone to the healers with a sharp greeting from their Katar. Both teams fought tooth and nail, trading possession like a hot rock, but neither could find the basket early on.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Fogel Raynold of the Chaos Creatures gets his hands on the ball in Center Field, winds up, and lets it fly! It's good! A TWO-POINT SHOT that sends the hometown crowd into a frenzy! You could feel the unstable scaffolding shake from here!\n\nBut hold on to your helmets, because the Runeguard had an answer! On the very next possession, Vivia Namara scoops up the ball, takes aim from the same spot, and LAUNCHES IT! BINGO! Another two-pointer! We were all tied up, and the tension was thicker than mud in a bog!\n\nBoth teams scrapped for an advantage, trading blows and bruises. Johnna Beetner was a whirlwind with her Scimitar, dropping Chaos Creatures left and right. But neither side could break the deadlock. The whistle blew, and that beautiful word echoed across the yard: OVERTIME!\n\nAnd what an overtime it was! This wasn't just Trollball; this was a glorious, choreographed brawl! We saw more mutual knockouts than I've seen all season! Shepperd Trefler and Wolbrom Ariella took each other down in a symphony of destruction! Lashondra Niehaus and Mouldon Earl traded blows and both ended up napping on the turf! You love to see it!\n\nPossession was a fleeting dream as the ball was fumbled, dropped, and stolen again and again. It looked like neither team would ever score. It seemed this perfect display of violence might never end, a testament to the Everwar itself!\n\nBut then, the moment arrived. Amidst the chaos, the Runeguard's own Johnna Beetner—who had been an absolute menace all night—got her hands on the Trollball. She tucked it under her arm and charged for the goal line!\n\nPlacido Kora of the Chaos Creatures made a valiant effort to stop her, but Beetner would not be denied! She slipped past the block and dove into the end zone! TOUCHDOWN! THE KERLAUGER RUNEGUARD WINS IT AT THE DEATH!\n\nAn absolutely stunning finish to an incredible game of Trollball. My congratulations to the Runeguard for a hard-fought victory, and my thanks to both teams for putting on a spectacular show of pure, unadulterated carnage! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! Now, let's see if this crowd riot is as good as the game was!",

      "## TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL IS ON THE AIR! 🎙️\n\nHello again, you beautiful brutes and belligerent beasts! This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the gilded stands of The Guilder's Field! The air here in New Prosperity is thick with the smell of gold and ozone, and I can tell you the crowd is absolutely electric! The bankers in their velvet boxes look a little nervous—they should be! We're not here to sign ledgers, we're here to see ledgers balanced in BLOOD!\n\nTonight, we've got a real clash of philosophies for you! In one corner, we have the hometown heroes, The New Prosperity Profits! A team that understands the value of a well-placed spear and a hostile takeover. I've seen Yoshi Cathy getting ready by eating a raw onion, layer by layer, without shedding a tear! Now that's the kind of intestinal fortitude you need to win! And Boleslaw Heathcote is over there huffing the smoke from burning parchment—a ritual after my own heart!\n\nAnd in the other corner, visiting from the oh-so-sanctimonious woods of Hafting, it's The Greenwatch! I'm sure their patron, Sir Randy, polished his fancy bow just for the occasion. They've got some interesting characters, I'll give them that. I saw Verne Methuselah rubbing the Trollball in their armpits for grip—a classic technique! But then you've got Madea Mensch, tying his own bootlaces together and hopping to the line. An adventurer, ladies and gentlemen! Let's hope his fighting is better than his coordination!\n\nThe whistle is about to blow, folks! Will the Profits' aggressive portfolio of pain pay dividends? Or will The Greenwatch's natural approach bear fruit? One thing's for sure: it's going to be a glorious, bone-crunching spectacle! Stick around, you don't want to miss a single knockout!",
    postGame:
      "## WHAT A FINISH! WHAT A GAME! 💥\n\nBy my blackened, beating heart, what a game we just witnessed, folks! If you love back-and-forth brutality, last-second heroics, and sheer, unadulterated chaos, then you got your money's worth tonight! The Guilder's Field is in an uproar as the hometown New Prosperity Profits snatch victory from the jaws of The Greenwatch in overtime!\n\n### A Second Half Slugfest\n\nNow, the first half must have been a real barn-burner, with The Greenwatch managing to squeak out two points somewhere in the carnage, but the action we saw after halftime was a masterclass in mayhem! The Profits came out of the break looking to make a statement, and Pellikka Concettina did just that, sending Rese Halpern to the healer's tent with a lovely poke from his spear! \n\nBut The Greenwatch answered right back! Troy Jorgan brought that Kirkhammer down on Boleslaw Heathcote, dropping the ball carrier and sending a message! This half was not going to be easy!\n\n### The Body Count Rises\n\nAnd what a beautiful mess it became! We had a double knockout, a sight I will never get tired of, as Herriott Dhiren and Yoshi Cathy took each other out of the action in a spectacular clash of steel! The healers were earning their pay, running back and forth like panicked goblins in a gold mine! Nariko Javed and Merissa Mathian were the busiest people in the stadium!\n\nThen came the play of the game! With bodies littering the field, the Profits' own Abramson Doxia scooped up the ball, found a sliver of space, and launched a perfect, glorious two-point shot right through the basket! The crowd went wild! That, my friends, is how you tie a game and seize the momentum! An absolutely stunning display of skill and power!\n\n### A Moment of True Trollball Spirit\n\nI have to give a special mention to a moment of pure, unadulterated Trollball. In the midst of the fray, Greenwatch's Rese Halpern somehow... and you can't make this up, folks... knocked *themself* out with their own club. I haven't seen a player go down with a self-inflicted injury that beautiful since Sir Artorias tried to impress a fey by wrestling a cactus! A truly unforgettable moment of athletic incompetence!\n\n### Overtime Thrills!\n\nThe battle raged on, with neither team giving an inch. The field was a blender of flailing limbs and dropped players, sending us into a sudden-death OVERTIME! The tension was so thick you could carve it with a Kriegsmesser!\n\nThe Profits came out hungry. Yoshi Cathy, the onion-eater, grabbed the ball and went on a tear, running through the Greenwatch defense like a man possessed! He shrugged off a block attempt and dove headfirst into the endzone for the winning touchdown! \n\n### The Final Word\n\nAnd that's your ballgame, folks! The final score, after a nail-biting overtime period, is **The New Prosperity Profits 3, The Greenwatch 2**! \n\nLet the celebration begin in the streets of New Prosperity! A hard-fought, well-deserved victory for the home team, built on grit, violence, and a couple of spectacular scoring plays from Abramson Doxia and Yoshi Cathy!\n\nThat's all the time we have for Tuesday Night Trollball! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you to always aim for the kneecaps! Good night, Osterra!",

      "Hello, hello, HELLO, you beautiful brutes and brawlers, and welcome to another spectacular Tuesday Night Trollball! This is your favorite demonic host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live with a matchup that's sure to be a bone-crunching classic! 🎙️ Tonight, the rugged challengers from the frontier, The South Pole Yetis, march into the manicured wilderness of Fletchings Field to take on the hometown heroes, Oak & Onslaught!\n\nThe Yetis are a tough bunch, hardened by the freezing rain and wolf packs of their home Palisade. They get ready for war in the most authentic ways! Their healer, Seiter Aida, gets in the zone by smelling their own game-worn socks! Now that’s dedication to the funk of war! Meanwhile, Isborne Krause asks a teammate to punch him square in the shoulder, and Udela Dorkus sharpens their wits by LICKING A WHETSTONE! My kind of people! ❄️\n\nAnd in the other corner, we have Oak & Onslaught, the pride of the Wardens. They’re a bit more... theatrical. Player Symer Crissy prepares by giving the Trollball a heroic backstory before the game. Oh, brother! I bet it's some drivel about how the ball is on a noble quest, probably inspired by that blowhard Artorias. Others, like Wynnie Faina, get ready by wearing their boots on the wrong feet. A strange tactic, but who am I to question what works? They'll need more than misplaced footwear to handle the raw power of the Yetis!\n\nIt's the wild frontier versus the curated forest! It’s bacon-greased boots versus heroic fables! The druids have shifted the terrain, the players are hungry for violence, and I am ready for the CRACK of armor and the cheer of the crowd! So grab your grog, place your bets (not with Yarp, he still won't take my business), and settle in! This is going to be a glorious mess! LET’S PLAY TROLLBALL! 💥",
    postGame:
      "### A Defensive Duel in Fletchings Field!\n\nWHAT A GAME, FOLKS! That was a masterclass in pain and perseverance! If you love hard hits, frantic scrambles, and a score settled by a single, brilliant act of athletic artistry, then this was the match for you! The South Pole Yetis have done it, shutting out the hometown favorites in a stunning display of grit!\n\n### First Half: The Meat Grinder\n\nThe first half was pure, unadulterated carnage, just the way I like it. The ball barely had time to rest! Oak & Onslaught's Affra Yanaton picked it up first, but was immediately STUFFED by Sayers Erdda of the Yetis, who snatched the ball away. That set the tone for the entire half: every inch was fought for, every possession paid for in blood and bruises.\n\nThe field became a whirlwind of combat! We saw Milt Casady use his Blackjack to send Coussoule Bidle to the sidelines for a nap. But you can't keep a good brawler down! Bidle came back later and returned the favor, and then some, taking out Millham Evangeline and Hole Bowerman with his trusty mallet. It was a beautiful, violent ballet of retribution! 🎭\n\nAnd the double knockouts! Oh, the glorious symmetry of mutual destruction! Sale Tocci and Abner Seidel faced off, Talwar against Talwar, and BOTH went down! Ajit Serge and Teria Ravo did the same with their War Picks! Then, just to prove it wasn't a fluke, Sale Tocci and Ema Ulrick took each other out of the game simultaneously! The healers on both sides were earning their pay, let me tell you!\n\nPossession was a fleeting dream. Ema Ulrick made a fantastic run for Oak & Onslaught, slipping past one defender only to be walled off by the immovable Udela Dorkus, forcing a fumble. The ball was dropped, passed, fumbled, and fought over in a beautiful chaotic scrum that left bodies littering the field. By the time the halftime whistle blew, the score was still a stubborn 0-0. All violence, no score. Perfect!\n\n### Second Half: A Shot in the Dark\n\nAfter the healers worked their magic and scraped our warriors off the turf, the second half began with the same ferocious intensity. The Yetis' Ajit Serge immediately went for a long bomb, a speculative shot from center field! It fell short, but what a statement of intent! They weren't here to play patty-cake with Sir Randy and his Warden pals.\n\nThe brutal back-and-forth continued. Isborne Krause of the Yetis was a one-man wrecking crew, sending two of Oak & Onslaught's players to the healer's tent with his flail. The momentum seemed to be swinging, but every advance was met with a crushing counter-attack. The ball was a hot potato nobody could hold onto for long.\n\nThe turning point came from a spectacular defensive play. Oak & Onslaught's Millham Evangeline was making a break for it, but was stopped dead in their tracks by Selima Si, who not only blocked the run but TOOK THE BALL! A massive momentum shift for the visitors from the South Pole!\n\nWith the Yetis now on the attack deep in enemy territory, the tension was thick enough to chew! The ball found its way to Sayers Erdda, who had been a defensive powerhouse all game. They found a sliver of space in the two-point zone, took a deep breath, and let it fly! The Trollball sailed through the air, a perfect arc against the sky... AND IT'S GOOD! IT'S GOOD! 🏀\n\n### Final Whistle: Yetis Conquer!\n\nWith a 2-0 lead, the Yetis just had to hold on. Oak & Onslaught mounted a desperate final charge, but a fumbled catch sealed their fate. The clock ran out, and the victory belonged to the tough-as-nails travelers from the south!\n\n**Your final score: The South Pole Yetis 2, Oak & Onslaught 0!**\n\nAn incredible victory for The South Pole Yetis, built on the back of a rock-solid defense and one moment of pure offensive genius from Sayers Erdda. They came into the Wardens' precious, shifting forest and showed them what real wilderness grit looks like! Maybe next time Oak & Onslaught should spend less time giving the ball a heroic backstory and more time practicing their catching! A truly magnificent game! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! KEEP IT BRUTAL! 🤘",

      "Hellooooooo Trollball fanatics and welcome back to TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! This is your favorite demonic announcer, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live with a matchup that's sure to be a real barn-burner! 🏟️🔥\n\nTonight, we have a clash of titans as the visiting Starlight Bazaar Bizarres step onto the treacherous turf of the Oread's Summit Tamers! The Bizarres, hailing from the ever-chaotic Prismatic Pavilion, are used to a bit of razzle-dazzle, what with their home field's 'Troupe Distractions' and 'Unstable Footing'. They're a flashy bunch, with players like Kristin Kronfeld getting ready by having a teammate punch her square in the shoulder! Now that's how you get your head in the game! And let's not forget Gagliano Tallbott, who warms up by telling the Trollball itself a terrible joke. You gotta love the showmanship!\n\nBut they're facing a tough, tough home team in the Oread's Summit Tamers! These warriors play in the High-Pass Pitch, where the air is thin and a sudden blizzard can change the game in a heartbeat! This isn't some friendly circus performance like you'd get from Kython's troupe; this is hard-nosed, high-altitude Trollball! The Tamers are primed for battle, with rituals that could make Sir Tanos himself tremble. Alwyn Wandy whispers a secret fear to the Trollball before the game begins! Chilling! And you've got Odericus Juxon, who gets ready by slapping their own helmet until their ears ring! You can feel the intensity from here, folks!\n\nWill the Bizarres' flair and festival energy overcome the sheer grit of the mountain-dwelling Tamers? Or will the home team prove that thin air and a strong arm are all you need for victory? Forget whatever political nonsense is happening in the Guild of the Black Sky, because THIS is the only drama that matters tonight! Get ready for a symphony of destruction, folks, because the first whistle is about to blow!",
    postGame:
      "WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! WHAT A GAME! An absolute masterclass in violence and strategy from whistle to whistle! The Oread's Summit Tamers have defended their home turf, taking down the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres with a final score of 4 to 2! An incredible display of high-altitude dominance!\n\nThe action started immediately! The Bizarres' Milo Nelie scooped up the ball and, without a moment's hesitation, knocked Swamy Ahasuerus clear out of play with a beautiful swing of their Military Fork! That's how you start a Trollball game! But the glory was short-lived as Nelie fumbled a pass, leading to a mad scramble for the ball!\n\nKristin Kronfeld recovered for the Bizarres and made a powerful run deep into Tamer territory. It looked like an early score was in the cards, but WAIT! Alwyn Wandy of the Tamers came up with a MONSTROUS block, stripping the ball and taking possession! What a reversal of fortune!\n\nWandy didn't waste a second. With the home crowd roaring, they launched the Trollball from the 2-point zone... AND IT'S GOOD! Two points for the Oread's Summit Tamers! The High-Pass Pitch erupts! What a beautiful, beautiful shot!\n\nThe Tamers were just getting started! After another fumble by the Bizarres, who should recover the ball but Alwyn Wandy AGAIN! This player was simply on fire! While Wandy controlled the ball, we saw some glorious carnage unfold. Clippard Burr's Lance sent Aggri Cookie to the sidelines, and then we had a spectacular double knockout between Dric Trilley and Quintessa Austine! This is the kind of beautiful brutality that makes Trollball the greatest sport in Osterra!\n\nCapitalizing on the chaos, the Tamers moved the ball with precision. A clean pass from Wandy found Kass Fogel in scoring position, and Fogel wasted no time, sinking ANOTHER 2-point shot! Just like that, the Tamers were up 4-to-nothing as the first half came to a close! The Bizarres tried to make a late push with Willa Lois, but the Tamer defense held strong!\n\nAfter a much-needed halftime break to stitch everyone back together, the second half began with an absolute explosion of violence! It was a whirlwind of steel and bone as players from both sides were sent flying! Swamy Ahasuerus knocked out Melesa Zelten, only to be knocked out by Kristin Kronfeld! We had double KOs, triple KOs, healers on both sides working harder than Dame Terra trying to find a prophet to kidnap! It was magnificent!\n\nAmidst the beautiful mayhem, the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres found a spark! After a blocked run and a turnover, Gagliano Tallbott got their hands on the Trollball. With a clear look at the goal, Tallbott fired a perfect shot, scoring 2 points for the visitors! The Bizarres were on the board! The comeback was on!\n\nBut the Tamers' defense stiffened. They weathered the storm of the Bizarres' desperate attacks, with Zadoc Wyatan and Clippard Burr making key blocks and shutting down running lanes. The fighting was fierce right to the end, with another stunning double KO between Willa Lois and Kass Fogel keeping the healers busy.\n\nThe final minutes saw the Tamers controlling the ball, fending off the last, desperate attempts from the Bizarres. A final fumbled pass was recovered by Kristin Kronfeld, but it was too little, too late! The whistle blew, and the home team, The Oread's Summit Tamers, stood victorious!\n\nA hard-fought victory for the Tamers, who used their first-half momentum and rugged defense to seal the deal. A valiant effort from the Bizarres, who showed incredible heart in their second-half comeback attempt. It was a game filled with everything we love: incredible scoring, bone-crunching hits, and non-stop action! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! What a night!",

      "## 🔥 TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL IS ON THE AIR! 🔥\n\nHello, hello, hello all you fiends, fanatics, and followers of the greatest sport in Osterra! This is your favorite demonic announcer, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live for another spectacular evening of bone-crunching, goal-scoring, soul-crushing action! And what a match-up we have for you tonight, folks! It's a classic clash of cultures, a battle of the brash and the bizarre!\n\nIn this corner, visiting from the dreary, windswept cliffs of the north, we have the **Southport Narwhals**! 🐋 These hardy folks are used to gale-force winds and rocky outcroppings, not the blinding sun and distracted tourists of their opponents' home turf. I hear their pre-game ritual involves telling each other tall tales about their own strength. Well, they'll need more than lies to win tonight, but that's a start I can get behind! Keep an eye on Cilurzo Sochor, who apparently gives the Trollball a heroic backstory before each game. Let's hope tonight's story has a glorious, violent ending!\n\nAnd in the other corner, playing on their home turf at the Buccaneer's Bowl on fancy-pants Toast Island, it's **The Tortell Privateers**! 🏴‍☠️ These buccaneers are used to the finer things in life, but don't let the resort security fool you, they're here to play rough! How rough? Well, Lilithe Royce is preparing by sticking leeches to her legs to 'lighten their step,' and Dib Tufts just chugged a raw egg, shell and all! That's the kind of dedication that warms my corrupted heart! They're fighting for the pride of Cedar Hill, so let's hope they do better than Elspeth Ortell at making a good impression!\n\nThe air is thick with anticipation, the crowd is roaring, and the players are practically vibrating with the need for violence! Will the hardy Narwhals freeze out the Privateers, or will the resort-town raiders make their guests proud? Stick around, folks, because the chaos is about to begin!",
    postGame:
      "## 💥 WHAT A WALLOPING! A SHUTOUT SPECTACULAR! 💥\n\nFolks, if you weren't tuned in, you missed an absolute masterclass in devastation! The visiting Southport Narwhals didn't just walk into the Buccaneer's Bowl; they stormed the beach, smashed the sandcastles, and left the home team wondering what just hit them!\n\n### The First Half Frenzy\n\nThe action started faster than Sir Artorias runs from a real challenge! The ball is barely in play before Southport's Blood Eppes scoops it up. And before the Privateers could even blink, Cilurzo Sochor sends Loralee Sunny to the dirt with a beautiful swing of his Hatchet! KNOCKED OUT! 🪓\n\nWith the defense still reeling, Blood Eppes seized the moment! He winds up from Center Field and lets it fly... IT'S GOOD! A two-point shot to open the game! The Narwhals go up 2-0 just like that! The tourists in the stands didn't know what to cheer for!\n\nBut the Narwhals weren't done, not by a long shot! Fineman Dolhenty gets the ball, tucks it under her arm, and weaves through the Privateers' defense like they were standing still! She crosses the line for another point! 3-0! An absolute blitzkrieg!\n\nOh, the Privateers tried to fight back, bless their little hearts. We saw some magnificent stalemates, with players locked in struggles that were pure poetry. But the Narwhals' fury was relentless. Torey Dannye turned into a one-man wrecking crew, knocking out Castorina Gies AND Ellan Elburt with that gorgeous Swordstaff! ⚔️\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, Cibis Areta sliced through the remaining defense and scored AGAIN for the Narwhals! Just before the half, the score was an unbelievable 4-to-NOTHING!\n\n### A Merciful Halftime\n\nThe halftime whistle was less of a break and more of a rescue mission for the Tortell Privateers. Their healer, Eugen Zacks, had his work cut out for him, scraping his players off the pristine turf while the Narwhals probably gargled saltwater and sharpened their weapons.\n\n### The Second Half Scramble\n\nThe second half was a desperate, chaotic scramble, and I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! The Privateers came out swinging, with Castorina Gies immediately knocking out Cibis Areta! But in a beautiful twist of violent fate, Areta took Gies down with her! A mutual knockout! You love to see that kind of spite!\n\nThe Narwhals continued their offensive push, with Blanc Fantasia making a heroic run from one end of the field to the other, but the Privateers' defense, finally showing a spark of life, forced a fumble. They managed to stop the bleeding, but they just couldn't get their own offense going.\n\nKeisling Damalas had a chance, a real shot at getting his team on the board, but his throw from the 2-point zone fell short! A heartbreaker for the home team! The Narwhals scooped up the ball and went on another long, grinding drive down the field, chewing up the clock and the Privateers' morale.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the Tortell Privateers were left standing on their perfect, imported turf without a single point to their name. A complete and utter domination by the visitors from the north!\n\n### FINAL SCORE\n\nYour final score tonight, folks, is a stunning testament to the power of the north! \n\n*   **The Southport Narwhals: 4**\n*   **The Tortell Privateers: 0**\n\nWhat a performance! The Narwhals came into a hostile, sunny environment and played their game with grit, power, and beautiful, beautiful violence. The Privateers have a lot to think about on that long walk back to the resort bar. Maybe they should try chugging two eggs next time.\n\nThat's all for tonight, my friends! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from another glorious night of TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! Keep it bloody!",
