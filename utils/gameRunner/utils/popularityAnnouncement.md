# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL: WEEK 2 WRAP-UP & THE BOOZE NEWS! 🎙️

**Greetings, gore-hounds, thrill-seekers, and degenerates of all shapes and sizes!** This is **Nok the Corrupter**, your voice from the void, buzzing with the static of pure adrenaline! ⚡

Week 2 is in the books, and by the Blackened Pit, it was a masterpiece of incompetence and injury! We saw friendly fire, we saw self-inflicted concussions, and—best of all—we saw the so-called "Champions of Light" get absolutely **humiliated**! But first, we have some business to attend to regarding the rules of engagement!

## 🗳️ FEATURE VOTE RESULTS: BOTTOMS UP! 🍺

The Tribunal of Terror (that’s me and the voices in my head) put the power in your hands! We asked how you wanted to spice up the violence, and you miserable lot voted for...

# 🏆 ALCOHOLIC INTERVENTION 🏆

That's right! The votes were tallied:

- **Alcoholic Intervention** (Winner! 🍻)
- **Natural Intervention**
- **Unnatural Intervention**
- **Commisioner Intervention**

It seems **Imra of Cedar Hill** has been slipping something into the water supply, because you fans want your athletes liquored up! 🥴 These changes won't hit the field just yet (we have to brew the "special" kegs first), so don't expect **Milt Casady** to be stumbling _more than usual_ next week. But soon... oh, soon, the coordination will drop, and the chaos will rise!

## 🩸 WEEK 2 HIGHLIGHTS: THE FALL OF IDOLS 🩸

Let's look at the carnage we just witnessed!

📉 **THE TEMPLE IS CLOSED!**
I have never been happier to read a stat sheet! The **Haven Lights**, the darlings of **Sir Artorias** and **High Priestess Oona**, didn't just lose... they were erased! **The New Prosperity Profits** walked into the Aegis Field and delivered a **5-0** beatdown! The Profits (backed by **Chairman Farno's** gold) looked like champions, while the Lights looked like they were trying to catch a greased pig in a hurricane! ZERO POINTS! HA!

🐍 **THE BANDWAGON CRASHES!**
You voted the **Zmeigorod Snessengers** the most popular team in the realm (a whopping score of 8!), and how did they repay you? By losing to **The Confluence Captains**! Not even **Valos the Eternal's** bog magic could save them from the high-altitude headache of the World's Spine. Just goes to show: popularity doesn't stop a poleaxe!

👊 **HITTING YOURSELF TO SAVE TIME**
We saw a plague of friendly fire this week! **Nigel Rothmuller** of Brimstone tackled his own teammate! But the award for "Most Spectacular Failure" goes to **Fogel Raynold** of **New Monteforte**, who managed to knock _himself_ out with his own Horseman's Pick! I haven't seen self-harm that funny since **Sir Tanos** tried to use a map!

🐳 **THE ONE-WOMAN ARMY**
**The Southport Narwhals** defeated the **South Pole Yetis**, but really, **Loralyn Lyndy** defeated the Yetis. She scored ALL 4 POINTS for her team! Someone give that woman a raise, or at least a free steak from **King Nezmear's** "special" herd.

## 🗳️ POPULARITY CONTEST: WEEK 3 🗳️

Listen up, you beautiful disasters! The **Zmeigorod Snessengers** had the most fans last week and still got flattened. **The Oread's Summit Tamers** and my beloved **Ebon Gate Corruptors** had ZERO support! Shameful!

Do you want your team to have the morale boost of a screaming mob? Do you want to prove your faction is the loudest? Then get to the voting booth! **The Guild of the Black Sky** is currently laughing at all of you with their wallets and their wins. Are you going to let the bean-counters win the popularity contest too?!

👉 **VOTE NOW! SCREAM LOUD! MAKE THEM BLEED!**

## ⚔️ WEEK 3: THE GRUDGE MATCHES ⚔️

Grab your tickets and hide your valuables, because next week's schedule is absolutely **DIABOLICAL**!

🎪 **The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres vs The Tortell Privateers**
_@ The Prismatic Pavilion_
Can **Kython's** circus freaks handle the pirates? It's glitter versus gunpowder!

❄️ **The New Ravenfall Commanders vs The South Pole Yetis**
_@ The Stronghold Bailey_
The Castle meets the Cold! **Dame Terra** hates snow, I assume. It makes a mess of her dirt magic.

🌵 **The Desert Spectres vs The Wyrmwood Stronghammers**
_@ The Sun-Baked Bowl_
Plants don't grow well in the desert, folks! **Geth's** skeleton crew looks to dry out the visitors!

🐳 **The Southport Narwhals vs The Zmeigorod Snessengers**
_@ The Cliffside Pitch_
Can the fan-favorite Snessengers bounce back against the Lighthouse squad? Or will the wind blow them off the cliff?

🔥 **The Brimstone Fire Eaters vs The Kerlauger Runeguard**
_@ The Su'akour Bowl_
My sulfur-soaked neighbors need a win! The Runeguard are coming off a massive upset victory. Something has to give!

💰 **The Confluence Captains vs The Greenwatch**
_@ The Glowstone Terrace_
**Chairman Ironrock** vs **Sir Randy**! Industry vs Nature! Will the Captains sell the Greenwatch for scrap?

🏔️ **The Oread's Summit Tamers vs The New Prosperity Profits**
_@ The High-Pass Pitch_
The Profits just destroyed Haven. Can they handle the thin air of the Summit? Or will they faint from lack of oxygen (and lack of soul)?

🌳 **Oak & Onslaught vs The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**
_@ Fletchings Field_
Expect riots in the forest! If the Chaos Creatures knock themselves out again, the trees might actually win this one.

👹 **THE MAIN EVENT: MY PERSONAL VENDETTA** 🛡️
**The Haven Lights vs The Ebon Gate Corruptors**
_@ The Aegis Field_
**THIS IS IT!** The darkness comes to the temple again! The Corruptors are fresh off a win. The Lights are reeling from a 5-0 loss. Can my sludge-covered boys drive the final nail into the coffin of Haven's dignity? **I PRAY TO THE VOID THAT THEY DO!**

Stay violent, Osterra! 😈
