Can you smell it, folks? That mixture of ozone, swamp mud, and the metallic tang of regret? It smells like... *incompetence*! \n\nThis week will go down in history as the \"Week of the Traitor!\" I have never seen so many players look at their own teammates and think, \"Yes, that is a face that needs a mace in it!\" We had friendly fire, we had overtime thrillers, and we had—much to my delight—the humiliation of the Haven Lights! Let’s dive into the gore! 🏊‍♂️🩸\n\n## 🤡 THE \"WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE\" AWARDS 🤡\n\nThree separate matches were decided by razor-thin margins (one point games!), and in all three, the chaos was absolute! \n\nFirst, let's look at **The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** defeating the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** **3-2**. Now, I love my Fire Eaters, but the Bizarres stole the show. Why? Because **Milo Nelie** and **Demp Chet**—TEAMMATES, mind you—got into a scrap over the ball and **Knocked Each Other Out!** 🥊😵 A double KO on the same squad! But get this: Milo woke up, realized what he did, and scored the winning points anyway! That is the kind of chaotic energy the Prismatic Troupe brings!\n\nOver in the **Tortell Privateers** vs. **Desert Spectres** match (Privateers won **4-3**), the heat must have cooked some brains. In the dying moments, **Dib Tufts** swung his axe and laid out his own teammate **Kidder Starkey**! 🪓 Friendly fire! Elspeth Ortell must be putting something extra spicy in those \"hydration\" potions!\n\nAnd up in the World's Spine, the **South Pole Yetis** froze out the **Confluence Captains** **3-2**. The Captains' **Carnahan Laud** decided the best way to help the team was to KO her own ally, **O'Conner Maighdlin**! Sir Garon Ironrock, I know you love doors, but maybe show your team where the *exit* is! 🚪\n\n## 📉 THE BLOWOUTS (AND MY PERSONAL PAIN) 📉\n\nAlright, let's rip the bandage off. My beloved **Ebon Gate Corruptors**... they broke my heart. They welcomed **The Greenwatch** to the Sinking Field and promptly got stomped **6-1**. 😭 The Greenwatch's **Herriott Dhiren** and **Darin Berliner** were scoring at will. Even a teammate Double-KO on the Greenwatch side couldn't save us. I blame the Wardens. **Sir Randy** probably enchanted their arrows or something. Cheaters!\n\nElsewhere in the realm, the **Wyrmwood Stronghammers** absolutely dismantled the **Oread's Summit Tamers** **8-2**! **Kerwin Gasper** was a machine! 🔨 And in the battle of the \"New\" cities, the **New Prosperity Profits** executed a hostile takeover on the **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**, winning **6-2**. It seems money *can* buy happiness, or at least a lot of goals. **Chairman Brennen Farno** is probably counting coins and cackling right now.\n\n## 🛡️ SHATTERED SHIELDS & DEFENSIVE GRINDS 🛡️\n\nNow for the news that makes me smile! 😁 **The Haven Lights**—those shiny, self-righteous do-gooders—got SHUT OUT in their own temple! **The Kerlauger Runeguard** walked into the Aegis Field and won **1-0** in Overtime! 🕐\n\nIt was a defensive slog. 0-0 at regulation. But in OT, **Shepperd Trefler** (who had already been KO'd once!) rose from the dead to score the winner. Take that, **Sir Tanos**! Your \"Sunbringer\" couldn't bring a single point! Ha!\n\nAlso, **Oak & Onslaught** managed to hold off the swampy **Zmeigorod Snessengers** **2-0**. **Wynnie Faina** played hero-ball, scoring the only points. I guess those weird boots of his actually work!\n\n## 🌊 GAME OF THE WEEK: THE COASTAL CLASH 🌊\n\nWe save the best for last! **The Southport Narwhals** vs. **The New Ravenfall Commanders**. \n\nThis game went to **OVERTIME** tied 2-2. We saw **THREE** Double Knockouts! Bodies were flying everywhere! But in the extra period, **Fineman Dolhenty** of the Narwhals dodged a block and sealed the deal! **Final Score: 3-2 Narwhals!** 🐳\n\nKing Nezmear's werewolves will be eating good tonight! The Commanders can take their poetry and their sadness back to the castle!\n\n---\n\nThat’s all for Week 2, you bloodthirsty maniacs! Remember: Check your targets, or you might just knock out your best friend! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off! 🎙️😈"
