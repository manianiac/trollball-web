Nok the Corrupter here, coming to you live and loud from the most delightfully dangerous corner of New Monteforte—The Unruly Yard! We are kicking off the Winners' Bracket in style today, and boy oh boy, you can practically smell the playoff fever in the air—or maybe that is just the smell of the nearby sewers and rebellion! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures are playing host to those squeaky-clean, holier-than-thou bores, The Haven Lights, and the crowd is absolutely feral! I saw a spectator trying to dismantle the unstable scaffolding with a rusty spoon earlier—now that is what I call team spirit! 🏟️\n\nThe atmosphere is electric, folks! We are talkin' Game One of a Best of Three series where the stakes are higher than a Fey on moon-dust! The winner stays in the Winners' Bracket, while the loser has to take the long, shameful walk down to the losers' side of the bracket. The Chaos Creatures are looking ready to rumble, with Boulanger Procto meticulously arranging his gear in a perfect spiral—honestly, for a bunch of rebels, they have got some strange habits! Meanwhile, Wolbrom Ariella is warming up the crowd with a sea shanty that is so out of tune it is technically a war crime! 🏴‍☠️\n\nOn the other side of the field, we have got the Haven Lights. Look at 'em over there, being all 'virtuous.' Zwart Bunns is currently whispering a secret fear to the Trollball. I hope he told it he is afraid of getting his teeth kicked in, because that is the Monteforte way! And look at Shiroma Salim, re-taping that shield handle for the hundredth time. Give it a rest, kid! You are in the Unruly Yard now; the only thing that shield is going to catch is a face-full of Monteforte grit! Let's get to the action! 💥","postGame":"Holy cow, what a marathon of carnage! I have seen some brutal displays in my time since Sir Tanos and Artorias busted me out of the Demon Prison, but this one really takes the cake—and then smashes the cake over someone's head! The Haven Lights managed to pull out a 13 to 7 victory in a game that felt like it lasted through three different regenerations! The 'heroes' of Haven might have won the scoreboard, but I think the Chaos Creatures won our hearts with the amount of blood they spilled on the turf! 🏆\n\nThe action started fast and mean! Alben Diantha of the Chaos Creatures showed us exactly why this stadium is called The Unruly Yard by absolutely leveling Shiroma Salim early on! But those Lights didn't stay down for long—Farand Keil silenced the rowdy crowd with a beautiful two-point shoot from the home field! It was a real poke in the eye for the local fans who were busy heckling the refs from the shaky scaffolding! 🏹\n\nBut don't you worry, the Chaos Creatures roared back! Tucker Hett went on a tear, charging straight into the end zone for a thunderous dunk that nearly took the basket off the floor! Then, thanks to a slick pass from Mouldon Earl, Wolbrom Ariella added another dunk to the tally! At that point, it looked like the Lights were flickering out, especially with Placido Kora handing out injuries like they were party favors at a cult meeting! 🎊\n\nThe middle of the game was a total bloodbath, just the way we like it! We had multiple halftimes because players were being carted off the field faster than they could be healed! Dickenson Beker and Riffle Heyde were taking some serious punishment, but that Riffle Harrington—the healer with the spiked gauntlet—was working overtime! Honestly, it is a miracle anyone was left standing to play the overtime period! 🚑\n\nSpeaking of overtime, that is when the wheels really came off for our Chaos friends. Zwart Bunns, the man of many fears, clearly conquered his stage fright! He went on an absolute rampage, scoring a dunk that put the Lights back in the driver's seat. It was a heartbreaker for the Monteforte faithful, who were already halfway through a riot in the stands! 💔\n\nI have to give a shout-out to Tybi Reo of the Lights. She managed a miraculous shoot from center field that went right through the hoop! Two points! You don't see that kind of luck every day, unless you are one of those annoying 'chosen ones' Artorias is always hanging out with. It was a total fluke, if you ask me, but the scoreboard doesn't care about my demonic opinions! 🏀\n\nThen came the late-game surge that sealed the deal. Dickenson Beker and Wieren Ivar both found the end zone for dunks, putting the game well out of reach. The Chaos Creatures tried to fight back with Alben Diantha scoring one last dunk to save face, but the damage was done. The Lights were just too persistent, like a bad case of holy rash that you just can't itch away! 🕯️\n\nAnd let's talk about the drunkenness! By the third overtime, I am pretty sure half the players were seeing double! I saw Raouf Dragone trying to tackle a street performer who wandered onto the field, and Riffle Heyde was drinking lukewarm water like it was the finest nectar in Osterra! The open bar at The Unruly Yard certainly lived up to its reputation, and I think some of those wild passes were more about the ale than the wind! 🍺\n\nSo, the Haven Lights take Game One of this Best of Three series. They move one step closer to staying in the Winners' Bracket, while the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures are going to have to do some soul-searching—or just more gear-spiraling—if they want to force a Game Three. Dame Terra Monteforte is probably fuming in her dirt-throne right about now, and I don't blame her! 🌋\n\nThat is it for this week's Tuesday Night Trollball report! The Lights win 13-7, the fans are currently setting fire to the concessions stand, and I am going to go find where Elspeth Ortell hid that ritual sangria! Until next time, keep your weapons sharp and your healers closer! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! 🎙️😈","week":1,"homeScore":7,"awayScore":13,"slug":"po-2-1-new-monteforte-haven","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Wieren Ivar in zone Center Field","Zwart Bunns runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Alben Diantha Tackles Shiroma Salim and INJURES THEM!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but misses!","Dickenson Beker tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Tybi Reo, but Tybi Reo blocks it!","Placido Kora Tackles Wieren Ivar and INJURES THEM!","Berkin Waters runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Farand Keil shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Coward Tarton in zone Center Field","Farand Keil runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Berkin Waters passes the ball to Riffle Heyde, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Home Field","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but misses!","Berkin Waters tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Boulanger Procto runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Dickenson Beker, but misses!","Coward Tarton tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm Tackles Dickenson Beker and INJURES THEM!","Gabriele Klehm throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Marlane Lounge in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Coward Tarton, but misses!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but Berkin Waters blocks it!","Farand Keil tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Mouldon Earl tries to Tackle Zwart Bunns, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm Tackles Riffle Heyde and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Coward Tarton, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Tybi Reo and INJURES THEM!","HALFTIME -
