This is Nok the Corrupter, your favorite demon of the airwaves, coming to you live from the wildflower-scented pits of The Hollow Mine! We’re in the thick of the Losers Bracket, Game 2 of a Best of 3 series, and the stakes are higher than the Watch Tower itself! My beloved Ebon Gate Corruptors are down one game to zero, and if they don't pull a win out of the mud today, their playoff dreams are going to be buried deeper than Lord Orzalon’s dignity! The atmosphere is electric—or maybe that's just the 'Humming Earth' under our feet making my teeth rattle! 🏟️⚡\n\nThe Wyrmwood Stronghammers have the home-field advantage today, and they’ve emerged from that mine shaft looking like they’ve been eating coal for breakfast! I spotted Godart Urissa earlier, and gee whiz, that oversized floppy hat is a real fashion statement—if you're a scarecrow! Meanwhile, over in the Corruptors' camp, Terle Chenay is leading a belching contest that’s loud enough to shatter the 'Tangled Vines' creeping up the stands! That’s the kind of team spirit I like to see—raw, gas-powered, and completely uncivilized! 👃🪮\n\nKeep an eye on the field, folks! Between the mine drafts blowing the ball off course and the strange energy buzzing in the dirt, this game is going to be a real corker! Bullion Iglesias was seen meditating in the corner—probably dreaming of all the heads he’s going to crack today! So, grab your snacks and a sturdy shield, because the playoff action is about to explode! Let’s see if the Corruptors can force a Game 3 or if the Stronghammers are going to hammer the final nail in the coffin! 🛡️🦴","postGame":"# 🏟️ POST-GAME WRAP-UP: THE STRONGHAMMERS SEAL THE DEAL! 🏟️\n\nGreat shades of the Abyss, what a heart-wrenching, bone-snapping conclusion to this series! The Ebon Gate Corruptors fought like cornered hell-hounds, but in the end, the Wyrmwood Stronghammers defended their turf with a 3-2 victory, sweeping the series two games to zero! I haven't seen this much disappointment since Morgwae tried to convince me that 'literacy' was a valuable skill! The Hollow Mine was buzzing, the fans were screaming, and the mud was flying in every direction! 🏟️🌪️\n\nThe game kicked off with a flurry of motion as Calvinna Isador snatched the troll head in the center field. She dodged through the defenses like she was skipping through one of those tea parties Maple likes to host! Before our boys could even get a grip on their sickles, the Stronghammers were on the move! Sabian Gleason, who spent his morning counting clouds, clearly had his eyes on the prize this afternoon, taking a long shot from the Away Field and nailing it for two points! Talk about a cold start for the Corruptors! 🎯💥\n\nBut the violence, oh the beautiful violence, was just getting started! Autumn Jodoin, fueled by raw eggs and determination, absolutely leveled Smith Syst with a tackle that sounded like a falling tree! Poor Smith was carted off early, and my heart just sank! Our Corruptors tried to regain some ground, but the defense was as thick as the ivy on the Watch Tower. Napoleon Anzovin finally showed some life, charging through the mud to set up a play that saw Bullion Iglesias dunk the ball into the goal! 1-2, and we were back in business, folks! 🏀🩸\n\nHalftime came and went, with the healers working overtime to patch up the wounded. The second half turned into a real slugfest! As Utter, the man who insists on being the last one out of the locker room, decided to make his presence felt! He lunged at Ultun Barthelemy with a tackle so fierce it sent the Stronghammer straight to the infirmary! It was a masterpiece of brutality that would make Sir Tanos weep into his cursed sword! ⚔️🦴\n\nNapoleon Anzovin wasn't done yet, either! He took his kirkhammer and absolutely flattened Autumn Jodoin in retaliation! The crowd went wild, or maybe they were just vibrating from the Humming Earth! Either way, the momentum felt like it was shifting! The Stronghammers were looking rattled, and the mine drafts were blowing favor toward the Ebon Gate! 📉👺\n\nHowever, the Stronghammers have a knack for being pests! Just when we thought we had them cornered, Calvinna Isador found a gap in the line! She sprinted into the end zone and dunked that troll head like she was putting a letter in a mailbox—only much more violent and satisfying! That put Wyrmwood up 3-1, and the clock was ticking down faster than a demon's patience at a peace summit! ⏳🏀\n\nAs Utter managed to snag one more dunk late in the game to bring it to 3-2, but it was too little, too late! The Stronghammers' defense held firm in the closing minutes. We saw another round of injuries as Bullion Iglesias took out Sabian Gleason, but the score remained unchanged. The whistle blew, and the Ebon Gate Corruptors' season came to a muddy, miserable end! 🏟️💀\n\nWhat a performance by the home team, though it pains me to say it! Godart Urissa’s interception of Napoleon Anzovin’s wild pass at the end was the final dagger in the heart! I’m sure Count Trez Arrigo is celebrating somewhere, counting his gold and laughing at my misery! The Stronghammers move on, and the Corruptors go home to lick their wounds and maybe eat more worms for next season! 🪱💰\n\nI must say, the 'Humming Earth' really seemed to mess with the Corruptors' passing game today. Smith Syst and Olnek Vizzone were dropping balls left and right! It’s hard to play catch when the ground is trying to shake your boots off! If only Sir Artorias had spent more time fixing the stadiums and less time being a celebrity, maybe we’d have a level playing field! But that's Trollball for you—unfair, bloody, and absolutely glorious! 🏟️🙌\n\nSo that’s it for this series! The Wyrmwood Stronghammers take it 2-0 and advance! To the Ebon Gate fans, keep your heads high—we’ll be back with more spikes and more spite next year! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most beautiful pit in Osterra! Don't let the sinkholes catch you on the way out! 🎙️🔥","week":2,"homeScore":3,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-2-2-wyrmwood-ebon-gate","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Calvinna Isador in zone Center Field","Calvinna Isador runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Judi Carrington tries to Tackle Sondra Elaina, but Sondra Elaina blocks it!","Calvinna Isador tries to Tackle Ellette Paz, but misses!","Olnek Vizzone tries to Tackle Ultun Barthelemy, but misses!","Olnek Vizzone tries to Tackle Sondra Elaina, but misses!","Kerwin Gasper passes the ball to Kerwin Gasper!","Amedeo Bari tries to Tackle Sabian Gleason, but misses!","Sabian Gleason shoots from Away Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Simsar Carrelli in zone Center Field","Autumn Jodoin Tackles Smith Syst and INJURES THEM!","Sondra Elaina tries to Tackle As Utter, but misses!","Sondra Elaina tries to Tackle Amedeo Bari, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Napoleon Anzovin, but Napoleon Anzovin blocks it!","Bullion Iglesias throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Amedeo Bari in zone Center Field","Amedeo Bari tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","As Utter passes the ball to As Utter, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Smith Syst in zone Center Field","As Utter tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Godart Urissa tries to Tackle Smith Syst, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Judi Carrington, but Judi Carrington blocks it!","Napoleon Anzovin runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Simsar Carrelli throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Napoleon Anzovin in zone Home Field","Autumn Jodoin tries to Tackle Napoleon Anzovin, but misses!","Ahasuerus An runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Cornela Piscatelli tries to Tackle Bullion Iglesias, but misses!","Odelia Abbott tries to Tackle Bullion Iglesias, but misses!","Bullion Iglesias runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Autumn Jodoin in zone Center Field","Ellette Paz tries to Tackle Cornela Piscatelli, but misses!","Sabian Gleason tries to Tackle Napoleon Anzovin, but misses!","As Utter Tackles Ultun Barthelemy and INJURES THEM!","Amedeo Bari tries to Tackle Cornela Piscatelli, but misses!","Amedeo Bari tries to Tackle Odelia Abbott, but Odelia Abbott blocks it!","Sondra Elaina passes the ball to Calvinna Isador, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Rebane Kendy in zone Center Field","Napoleon Anzovin Tackles Autumn Jodoin and INJURES THEM!","Odelia Abbott passes the ball to Calvinna Isador, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Rebane Kendy in zone Center Field","Sondra Elaina runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Sabian Gleason tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Rebane Kendy tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Odelia Abbott runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Rebane Kendy tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Bullion Iglesias tries to Tackle Cornela Piscatelli, but misses!","Calvinna Isador runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Ellette Paz in zone Center Field","Napoleon Anzovin runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Ellette Paz runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Godart Urissa tries to Tackle Napoleon Anzovin, but misses!","As Utter runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Calvinna Isador in zone Center Field","Odelia Abbott throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Napoleon Anzovin!","Bullion Iglesias Tackles Sabian Gleason and INJURES THEM!","Bullion Iglesias tries to Tackle Sondra Elaina, but misses!","Smith Syst passes the ball to Olnek Vizzone, but they drop it!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
