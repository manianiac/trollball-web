It’s your favorite voice of the void, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the Prismatic Pavilion! 🏟️ The air is thick with the smell of funnel cake, salt water, and the impending doom of a Best of 3 series! We’ve got the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres hosting the Tortell Privateers, and let me tell you, the desperation in this stadium is more delicious than a soul-shard sundae! 🍦\n\nDown on the field, the rituals are in full swing! I just saw the Privateers' Castorina Gies bribing a local oracle with a meat pie. I hope that oracle told him to duck, because the Bizarres look hungry! Speaking of the Bizarres, Gagliano Tallbott is currently telling a knock-knock joke to the Trollball itself. 🤡 Whether the ball laughs or not, we’re in for a spectacle! This stadium is built on stilts over the lagoon, and I’m personally hoping to see some 'heroes' like that ringleader Kython take a tumble into the drink! \n\nThe Tortell crowd is out in force tonight, clearly hoping their Privateers can pillage a win on the road. The atmosphere is electric, the footing is unstable, and the violence is guaranteed! Grab your grog, place your bets with someone other than Yarp—I don't trust his odds—and let’s get ready for some TROLLBALL! 🏈💀","postGame":"Holy smokes, what a display of absolute carnage we just witnessed! Game 1 of this series is in the books, and the Tortell Privateers have drawn first blood—literally and figuratively! 🩸 The final score stands at 2 to 0 in favor of the Privateers, but the scoreboard doesn't even begin to tell the tale of the carnage on this unstable Prismatic Pavilion! 🏟️\n\nRight out of the gate, Loralee Sunny scooped up the head in Center Field, but the real star of the opening act was Ellan Elburt! He didn't just play the game; he dismantled it by absolutely leveling Milo Nelie! Poor Milo was sent to the sidelines before the first whistle had even cooled down! 🏥\n\nBut Elburt wasn't finished! He took aim from Home Field and sent that leathery troll head sailing through the goal for a magnificent 2-point Shoot! 🎯 That’s the kind of precision that makes a demon weep with joy! The Privateers were running circles around the Bizarres, who seemed more distracted by the lagoon splashes than the game!\n\nWe saw Melisande Eustacia and Keisling Damalas trying to push the tempo, but the Bizarres' defense held firm for a moment, even if they couldn't find the ball themselves. Gagliano Tallbott was busy trying to tackle Kidder Starkey, but Starkey stood his ground like a fortress! 🏰\n\nJust when you thought the Bizarres might mount a comeback before the half, Kristin Kronfeld managed to snag the ball, but the momentum was as shaky as the stage-planks beneath their feet! Halftime came just in time for the healers to patch up the holes in the rosters! 🩹\n\nIn the second half, the violence reached a fever pitch! Lilithe Royce was making a daring run for the goal when she was absolutely flattened by Quintessa Austine! But don't feel too bad for Lilithe, because the Privateers got their revenge when Melisande Eustacia turned the tables and sent Austine to the dirt! 👊\n\nAnd let's talk about Milo Nelie. The poor soul returned to the field only to be targeted by Castorina Gies! Gies delivered a tackle so fierce it sent Milo right back to see Healer Essa Pattie for the second time tonight! Talk about a rough day at the office! 🚑\n\nThe Bizarres tried to find their rhythm, with Demp Chet even managing to gain possession late, but the clock was their worst enemy. The 'heroes' of the Prismatic Troupe probably should have spent less time on their theatrical poses and more time on their blocking drills! 🎭\n\nI haven't seen this much uncoordinated stumbling since the last time I saw Sir Garon Ironrock trying to navigate a particularly tricky door! The Privateers played like they had something to prove, and they certainly proved they can handle the pressure of the Losers Bracket! 🏴‍☠️\n\nSo, the Tortell Privateers take a 1-0 lead in this Best of 3 series! The Bizarres have their backs against the lagoon now. If they don't find a way to score in Game 2, they'll be packing their greasepaint and heading home early! 🎪\n\nWhat a night! What a match! The Privateers leave with the win, and the Bizarres leave with enough bruises to paint a rainbow! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a night of beautiful, chaotic Trollball! Stay brutal, Osterra! 💀✨","week":1,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-2-1-starlight-bazaar-tortell","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Loralee Sunny in zone Center Field","Ellan Elburt Tackles Milo Nelie and INJURES THEM!","Loralee Sunny tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but misses!","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but misses!","Dib Tufts runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but misses!","Goldberg Tova tries to Tackle Gagliano Tallbott, but misses!","Ellan Elburt shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Castorina Gies in zone Center Field","Bush Heiner tries to Tackle Goldberg Tova, but Goldberg Tova blocks it!","Melisande Eustacia tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Loralee Sunny, but misses!","Keisling Damalas tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Payson Jan tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but misses!","Aggri Cookie tries to Tackle Dib Tufts, but misses!","Lilithe Royce runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Gagliano Tallbott tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but Kidder Starkey blocks it!","Dib Tufts tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but Aggri Cookie blocks it!","Kidder Starkey tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Aggri Cookie tries to Tackle Lilithe Royce, but misses!","Goldberg Tova runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but Kidder Starkey blocks it!","Lilithe Royce throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Melisande Eustacia in zone Home 2-Point","Gagliano Tallbott tries to Tackle Loralee Sunny, but Loralee Sunny blocks it!","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Payson Jan, but misses!","Payson Jan tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Melisande Eustacia throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Kristin Kronfeld in zone Home 2-Point","Melesa Zelten runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Gagliano Tallbott runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Lilithe Royce in zone Center Field","Lilithe Royce runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but misses!","Quintessa Austine tries to Tackle Melisande Eustacia, but misses!","Quintessa Austine tries to Tackle Loralee Sunny, but misses!","Dib Tufts tries to Tackle Milo Nelie, but misses!","Melisande Eustacia passes the ball to Ellan Elburt, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Payson Jan in zone Home Field","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but misses!","Milo Nelie tries to Tackle Kidder Starkey, but misses!","Bush Heiner tries to Tackle Melisande Eustacia, but Melisande Eustacia blocks it!","Quintessa Austine tries to Tackle Ellan Elburt, but Ellan Elburt blocks it!","Milo Nelie Tackles Goldberg Tova and INJURES THEM!","Loralee Sunny tries to Tackle Kristin Kronfeld, but misses!","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Castorina Gies, but Castorina Gies blocks it!","Bush Heiner tries to Tackle Dib Tufts, but misses!","Gagliano Tallbott tries to Tackle Melisande Eustacia, but Melisande Eustacia blocks it!","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Ellan Elburt, but misses!","Demp Chet tries to Tackle Castorina Gies, but Castorina Gies blocks it!","Payson Jan tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Lilithe Royce runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Melisande Eustacia tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Quintessa Austine Tackles Lilithe Royce and INJURES THEM!","Castorina Gies tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Melisande Eustacia shoots from Home 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Demp Chet in zone Home 2-Point","Melisande Eustacia Tackles Quintessa Austine and INJURES THEM!","Castorina Gies Tackles Milo Nelie and INJURES THEM!","Kidder Starkey tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but Demp Chet blocks it!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
