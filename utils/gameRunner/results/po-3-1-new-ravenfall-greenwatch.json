It is a beautiful, blood-soaked evening here in New Ravenfall, and boy oh boy, do we have a doozy for you! Welcome to the Losers Bracket of the playoffs, where the stakes are higher than a soul in the Demon Prison! It is Game One of a Best of Three series between the hometown favorites, The New Ravenfall Commanders, and the grit-and-grind visitors, The Greenwatch! The atmosphere here at The Stronghold Bailey is absolutely electric! The fans are packed onto those stone ramparts like sardines in a tin, and the 'Castle Echo' is making every cheer sound like a thunderclap from the gods themselves! The Commanders are riding high on local support, but don't count out the Greenwatch just yet—they thrive in the dirt! Speaking of the dirt, I caught a glimpse of some pre-game antics that would make a gargoyle blush! Over in the Greenwatch camp, Verne Methuselah was seen rubbing the game ball deep into her armpits for that 'extra grip,' while Rese Halpern was taking deep, long whiffs of some game-worn socks that smelled like a swamp’s basement! On the other side of the pitch, the Commanders are keeping it classy with their own brand of weird. Estes Adrian is munching on honeycomb to sweeten the coming victory, and I saw Theis Loredo and Pirozzo Opal sharing a piece of fermented fish that smelled worse than a week-old corpse! It is all part of the magic, folks! Whether it is wiggling fingers or searching for four-leaf clovers like Dusa Curson, these players are ready to tear each other limb from limb for your entertainment! The Wardens are out in force supporting the Greenwatch, while the Eponore elites are looking down from the high towers, probably wondering if Sir Tanos will have to come down here and show them how to swing a mace! But enough talk! The cobblestones are dry, the troll head is fresh, and the violence is about to begin! Hold onto your hats, because Tuesday Night Trollball is LIVE!","postGame":"What a spectacular display of organized carnage we just witnessed, sports fans! It was a real barn-burner that went all the way to the wire! The Greenwatch has silenced the home crowd here at The Stronghold Bailey with a nail-biting 1-0 victory in Overtime! I haven't seen this much tension since Sir Artorias tried to explain the concept of mercy to a manticore! The game started with a defensive stalemate that would make even the stoic Sir Randy weep with joy. The cobblestone pitch was slick with sweat and just a hint of blood early on as both teams struggled to find their rhythm. The first half was a flurry of missed opportunities, with Verne Methuselah firing a shot that went wide enough to hit a spectator on the ramparts! But the violence? Oh, the violence was top-shelf! Drona Jacklin set the tone early by absolutely de-cleating Pirozzo Opal, sending the poor lad straight to Nariko Javed’s healing tent with an injury that looked like a folded lawn chair! Not to be outdone, Verne Methuselah decided to play surgeon herself, tackling Jessalin Zobias with such ferocity that the sound echoed off the castle walls like a dinner bell! The Commanders tried to strike back, with Theis Loredo delivering a crushing blow to Madea Mensch that left the Greenwatch player seeing stars and singing like a canary! By the time we hit the halftime whistle, the score was a goose egg for both sides, but the injury list was growing faster than a warlock's tab at the local tavern! The second half was a frantic scramble for possession. Rhett Gavrilla was doing their best to carry the Commanders on their back, picking up the ball and dodging Kirkhammers left and right, but the Greenwatch defense held firm like a rusted gate! Salahi Bushey thought he had a clear path, but Estes Adrian—the honeycomb hero himself—stepped in for a magnificent interception that had the home fans screaming for a goal! When the regulation whistle blew and the score remained tied at zero, you could feel the desperation in the air! It was time for Overtime, the period where legends are made and bones are broken! The healers worked overtime to patch the players back together, but as soon as the whistle blew, it was back to the butchery! Darin Berliner, apparently holding a grudge, found Pirozzo Opal again and delivered another bone-shattering tackle that sent Pirozzo right back to the sidelines! Talk about a bad day at the office! The Commanders’ Rhett Gavrilla finally lost their cool and hammered Troy Jorgan into the dirt, but the Greenwatch would not be denied! Nobe Haukom, the beard-plucker himself, started a magnificent run down the field, dodging Moir Sass and skipping over the cobblestones like a mountain goat on a mission! The defense was closing in, the shadows of the ramparts were lengthening, and the pressure was mounting! Then, in the blink of an eye, the ball found its way to Rese Halpern! Rese, still probably smelling those lucky socks, put on a burst of speed that left the Commanders' defense looking like they were stuck in molasses! With one final, glorious leap, Rese Halpern crossed into the End Zone and slammed that leather troll head down for the winning touchdown! The Greenwatch takes Game One of this series, leaving the Commanders and their high-and-mighty supporters from Eponore looking quite dejected! Sir Tanos is going to have a few choice words for this squad tonight, I’d wager! It just goes to show you, all the epic poems and fermented fish in the world can't save you when a Greenwatch player decides they want it more! What a way to kick off the playoffs! We’ll see you for Game Two, where the Commanders will be fighting for their lives! Until then, this is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you to keep your weapons sharp and your healers closer! Goodnight, Osterra!","week":1,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":1,"slug":"po-2-1-new-ravenfall-greenwatch","plays":["HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Madea Mensch in zone Away Field","Dusa Curson tries to Tackle Drona Jacklin, but Drona Jacklin blocks it!","Verne Methuselah shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Croteau Osmo in zone Away Field","Fleme Alis passes the ball to Jozef Pepe!","Drona Jacklin Tackles Pirozzo Opal and INJURES THEM!","Estes Adrian tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Darin Berliner tries to Tackle Jessalin Zobias, but misses!","Nobe Haukom tries to Tackle Theis Loredo, but misses!","Jessalin Zobias shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Rese Halpern in zone Away Field","Madea Mensch tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Rese Halpern tries to Tackle Estes Adrian, but misses!","Nobe Haukom tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Estes Adrian tries to Tackle Troy Jorgan, but misses!","Madea Mensch passes the ball to Nobe Haukom, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Rhett Gavrilla in zone Away Field","Goldenberg Rimola tries to Tackle Rhett Gavrilla, but misses!","Fleme Alis tries to Tackle Madea Mensch, but misses!","Rhett Gavrilla tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Rhett Gavrilla tries to Tackle Troy Jorgan, but Troy Jorgan blocks it!","Verne Methuselah Tackles Jessalin Zobias and INJURES THEM!","Estes Adrian throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Darin Berliner in zone Away Field","Theis Loredo Tackles Madea Mensch and INJURES THEM!","Darin Berliner passes the ball to Drona Jacklin!","Salahi Bushey throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Estes Adrian!","Nobe Haukom tries to Tackle Croteau Osmo, but misses!","Nobe Haukom tries to Tackle Estes Adrian, but misses!","OVERTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Drona Jacklin in zone Away Field","Moir Sass tries to Tackle Salahi Bushey, but misses!","Drona Jacklin tries to Tackle Rhett Gavrilla, but misses!","Rhett Gavrilla tries to Tackle Rese Halpern, but Rese Halpern blocks it!","Jozef Pepe tries to Tackle Salahi Bushey, but misses!","Pirozzo Opal tries to Tackle Rese Halpern, but Rese Halpern blocks it!","Darin Berliner Tackles Pirozzo Opal and INJURES THEM!","Croteau Osmo tries to Tackle Drona Jacklin, but misses!","Theis Loredo tries to Tackle Salahi Bushey, but misses!","Troy Jorgan shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Darin Berliner in zone Away Field","Moir Sass tries to Tackle Nobe Haukom, but misses!","Rhett Gavrilla Tackles Troy Jorgan and INJURES THEM!","Nobe Haukom runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Moir Sass tries to Tackle Darin Berliner, but misses!","Jessalin Zobias tries to Tackle Salahi Bushey, but misses!","Pirozzo Opal tries to Tackle Nobe Haukom, but Nobe Haukom blocks it!","Nobe Haukom runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Moir Sass tries to Tackle Nobe Haukom, but misses!","Darin Berliner runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Theis Loredo tries to Tackle Darin Berliner, but misses!","Rhett Gavrilla tries to Tackle Troy Jorgan, but misses!","Rese Halpern runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
