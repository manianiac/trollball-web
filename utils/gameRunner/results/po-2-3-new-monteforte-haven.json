This is Nok the Corrupter, the demon you love to fear, coming to you live and loud from the graffiti-splattered, bone-crunching glory of The Unruly Yard! 🏟️ We are at the fever pitch, the absolute boiling point of Tuesday Night Trollball! It’s Game Three of the Winners' Bracket playoffs! The Haven Lights and the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures have traded blows like a pair of drunken giants, and now it all comes down to this rubber match! The winner stays in the sunlight of the Winners' Bracket, and the loser? Well, they’ll be taking the long, shameful descent into the Losers' Bracket. Gee whiz, I haven't been this excited since Artorias and Morgwae broke me out of that dreary Demon Prison! ⛓️\n\nThe atmosphere here in New Monteforte is practically vibrating with hostility! The 'Rowdy Crowd' is out in force, and the 'Unstable Scaffolding' is creaking under the weight of fans who haven't seen a bath or a peaceful day in years! Looking down at the pitch, the Chaos Creatures are going through their bizarre motions. Alben Diantha is currently plunging his hands into a bucket of ice-cold well water—talk about a chilly reception! 🧊 Meanwhile, Wolbrom Ariella is belting out a sea shanty so horrendously out of tune that I think the Trollball itself is trying to sprout ears just to cover them! It’s pure, unadulterated passion, folks!\n\nAnd what about those Haven Lights? They’ve brought their 'virtue' and their 'Hallowed Ground' nonsense into the lion’s den! Look at Coward Tarton over there, kissing her biceps and whispering sweet nothings to her own muscles. 💋 It’s a bit much, isn't it? And Zwart Bunns is leaning over the Trollball, whispering his secret fears. I hope his biggest fear is a Warhammer to the teeth, because Wieren Ivar looks like he’s ready to deliver! The tension is thick enough to cut with a Rondel dagger, and the open bar is already flowing! If you aren't drinking, you aren't watching it right! Let’s get to the carnage! 🍺💥","postGame":"Jumpin' Jehosaphat, what a display of gridiron gore! Nok the Corrupter here, and my horns are still buzzing from that defensive masterclass! It was a low-scoring affair on the board but a high-scoring one for the local undertakers! 💀 The Haven Lights have managed to clinch the series with a 2 to 1 victory, proving that sometimes being a buzzkill actually pays off. I wanted to see the Chaos Creatures pull it off for the home crowd, but the Lights just wouldn't let the fire of rebellion stay lit! 🕯️❌\n\nThe game kicked off with Marlane Lounge snagging the Trollball right in the center field. The Chaos Creatures didn't wait to play nice, though! Wolbrom Ariella immediately went for the throat, tackling Zwart Bunns so hard it sent him straight to the infirmary! 🚑 That’s the Monteforte spirit! Wieren Ivar tried to make a break for it, but the Chaos defense was stickier than a warlock’s debt. It was a scramble for the ages, with bodies hitting the dirt faster than Sir Tanos hits a tavern! 🍻\n\nThe violence didn't stop there, no sir! Marlane Lounge, clearly seeking some holy retribution, absolutely flattened Fogel Raynold! The sound of that impact was music to my ears, like a symphony of cracking ribs! 🎶 But then, the tables turned when Placido Kora retaliated by injuring Lounge right back! It was a literal 'eye for an eye' out there, and I suspect even Geth the Gravelord was taking notes on the body count! 🦴\n\nThen came the play that changed the game. Riffle Heyde, after a frantic scramble, secured the ball deep in Chaos territory. With the defense closing in, Zwart Bunns—who had clearly recovered from his earlier nap—let fly with a spectacular shot from the 2-point zone! 🎯 SWISH! Two points for the Lights! The Unruly Yard went silent for a microsecond before the booing reached a level that probably rattled the windows in the Temple of Light! ⛪\n\nJust before we could catch our breath for halftime, Tybi Reo decided she hadn't done enough damage and sent Wolbrom Ariella to the sidelines with a nasty injury. The 'heroes' of Haven sure talk a big game about light and hope, but they've got no problem breaking a few legs when the playoffs are on the line! 🦵 I love the hypocrisy; it’s almost demonic in its beauty! 😈\n\nHalftime saw everyone patched up and sent back out, likely fueled by some of that hot gravy Lian Denton loves so much. The second half started with a vengeance! Shiroma Salim wasted no time in knocking Wolbrom Ariella right back out of the game! 🤕 It was like a revolving door for the poor guy. If I were him, I’d stick to the sea shanties and stay off the pitch for a while! 🎤\n\nBut wait! The Chaos Creatures weren't dead yet! Gabriele Klehm and Raouf Dragone pushed the ball forward with the kind of desperation you only see in the Winners' Bracket. Finally, Wolbrom Ariella—back on his feet again—sprinted into the end zone and slammed the ball home for a dunk! 🏀 The crowd erupted, the scaffolding swayed, and for a moment, it looked like New Monteforte might just steal the series! 1-2! The comeback was on!\n\nAlas, the Haven Lights decided to play 'keep-away' with the Chaos Creatures' health bars. Riffle Heyde took out Fogel Raynold (again!), Berkin Waters leveled Tucker Hett, and Wieren Ivar sent Gabriele Klehm to see the healer. 🏥 It was a systematic dismantling of the Monteforte roster. Every time the Creatures tried to get a pass going, a mace or a billhook was there to interrupt the conversation! 🔨\n\nBy the final whistle, the 'Unruly Yard' looked more like a hospital ward. Zwart Bunns even managed to injure Fogel Raynold one more time just for good measure! I think Fogel is going to be seeing twin lights for a week! 😵 The drunkenness in the stands was matched only by the exhaustion on the field. I saw a street performer trying to juggle broken helmets near the end zone, and frankly, he was the only one not bleeding! 🤡\n\nSo, the Haven Lights take the game 2 to 1 and win the series 2 games to 1! 🏆 They advance through the Winners' Bracket, while the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures are headed down to the Losers' Bracket to fight for their lives. It’s a bitter pill to swallow for the home fans, who are currently expressing their disappointment by throwing rocks at the library windows. 🪨📚\n\nThat wraps up a truly brutal week of Trollball! The 'heroes' move on, the rebels fall back, and I’m going to go see if Imra has any of that 'Dust' left to take the edge off this Haven victory. 🍹 This is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that in Trollball, the only thing that stays dead is your dignity! Goodnight, Osterra, and keep swinging those hammers! 🎙️😈","week":3,"homeScore":1,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-2-3-new-monteforte-haven","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Marlane Lounge in zone Center Field","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but Berkin Waters blocks it!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Zwart Bunns and INJURES THEM!","Wieren Ivar runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Zwart Bunns, but misses!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Wieren Ivar, but Wieren Ivar blocks it!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Wieren Ivar, but misses!","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Wieren Ivar passes the ball to Marlane Lounge!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but Marlane Lounge blocks it!","Marlane Lounge Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but Tucker Hett blocks it!","Wieren Ivar runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Placido Kora Tackles Marlane Lounge and INJURES THEM!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Riffle Heyde, but misses!","Shiroma Salim tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Riffle Heyde, but misses!","Wieren Ivar passes the ball to Farand Keil, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Riffle Heyde in zone Home 2-Point","Dickenson Beker passes the ball to Coward Tarton, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Dickenson Beker in zone Home 2-Point","Zwart Bunns shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Center Field","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but Placido Kora blocks it!","Tybi Reo Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Alben Diantha tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Berkin Waters tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Center Field","Shiroma Salim Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but Urata Oriana blocks it!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Raouf Dragone runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wolbrom Ariella runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Coward Tarton, but Coward Tarton blocks it!","Riffle Heyde Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Coward Tarton tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but Raouf Dragone blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Coward Tarton, but Coward Tarton blocks it!","Wieren Ivar tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but Urata Oriana blocks it!","Berkin Waters Tackles Tucker Hett and INJURES THEM!","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Wieren Ivar Tackles Gabriele Klehm and INJURES THEM!","Zwart Bunns Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Zwart Bunns tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but Alben Diantha blocks it!","Boulanger Procto tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Mouldon Earl runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Berkin Waters tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Coward Tarton tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but misses!","Shiroma Salim Tackles Urata Oriana and INJURES THEM!","Zwart Bunns tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!"],"bracket":"Winners"}
