This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the mossy, fog-drenched stones of **The Old Fort** in Kerlauger! 🏟️ We’ve got a real barn-burner on our hands tonight as we kick off the Losers Bracket playoffs! It’s Game 1 of a Best-of-3 series, and the stakes couldn't be higher—lose this series, and you’re packing your bags for the long walk of shame back to reality! The atmosphere is electric, despite the **Dense Fog** rolling in off the hills, making it nearly impossible to see the runes on these ancient standing stones. \n\nOur visitors today are the darlings of the realm, **The Zmeigorod Snessengers**! 🐍 The crowd is absolutely deafening for these swamp-dwellers; it seems everyone from the Bog Queen’s court has made the trip! I just saw **Delija Dowling** in the dugout chugging a raw egg—shell and all! 🥚 Talk about a protein boost! Meanwhile, their captain **Dare Wynnie** is busy painting mud stripes on everyone’s faces. It’s tribal, it’s messy, and it’s exactly what I love to see! They’re looking to bring that Zmeigorod grit to the highlands tonight.\n\nBut don't count out the home team, **The Kerlauger Runeguard**! 🛡️ They’re playing in their own backyard, even if that backyard is a pile of **Ancient Ruins** with **Uneven Footing** that’ll snap an ankle as soon as look at you! They aren't quite the fan favorites the Snessengers are—maybe the White Ravens should've spent less time kidnapping prophets and more time on PR! I caught **Lashondra Niehaus** getting absolutely belted in the shoulder by a teammate just to get the blood flowing. Now that’s a pre-game ritual I can get behind! Grab your refreshments and stay close to the radio, folks, because the violence is about to begin!","postGame":"Good grief, what a display of athletic carnage! The first game of this playoff series is in the books, and the **Zmeigorod Snessengers** have slithered away with a 4-2 victory over the Kerlauger Runeguard! 🐍 It was a battle of attrition out there in the fog, and while the Runeguard had the home-field advantage of knowing where the biggest rocks were, they just couldn't withstand the late-game surge from the swamp-folk. \n\nThe action started fast and furious! **Lorilee Aldred** snatched the troll head right out of the gate in Center Field, and after some quick-fire passing, **Benjie Foulk** absolutely nailed a shot from the Away 2-Point zone! 🎯 A 2-0 lead for the Runeguard early on had the home crowd—all twelve of them—going wild! It looked like the Snessengers were reeling from the altitude.\n\nThen came the brutality we all tune in for! **Shepperd Trefler** of the Runeguard decided he’d had enough of the Snessengers' civic engagement and went on a rampage. He used those spiked gauntlets to absolutely level **Alded Sanjay** and **Dare Wynnie** in back-to-back plays! 💥 Both Snessengers were sent to the healer’s tent before the first half was even halfway through. That's the kind of initiative that makes a demon’s heart sing!\n\nThere was a moment of hope for Zmeigorod when **Arni Griffith**—who I’m told gives the trollball a heroic backstory before every game—showed he’s more than just a storyteller by intercepting a wild pass from Lorilee Aldred! 🏈 It stopped a certain touchdown and kept the Snessengers in the hunt going into the halftime break. \n\nAfter the healers did their magic and everyone was back on the field, the Snessengers finally found their rhythm. **Rose Kluge**, who I saw tensing every muscle in her body like a coiled spring earlier, finally snapped! She found an opening in the Home Field and fired a shot that sailed right through the goal! 🥅 Just like that, we were tied up at 2-2! \n\nThe momentum had completely shifted. The Runeguard’s **Johnna Beetner** tried to answer back, but her shot went wide, probably caught in a sudden gust of that thick Kerlauger fog. The Snessengers didn't miss their next chance, though. **Alded Sanjay**, clearly recovered from his earlier trip to the infirmary, took a pass in Center Field and buried another 2-point shot! ☄️\n\nThe Runeguard tried to get physical again to claw back into it. **Benjie Foulk** lived up to his name by tackling **Gere Cordelie** so hard it left a dent in the turf! Gere was carried off, but the damage was already done. The Snessengers played keep-away for the final minutes, navigating the **Uneven Footing** with the grace of a bog-adder.\n\nYou have to feel for the Runeguard; they fought hard, but the popularity of Zmeigorod seems to carry a luck all its own. Maybe if **Dame Terra Monteforte** spent more time coaching and less time digging in the dirt, they’d have better results! But let's be honest, we're all just here for the injuries, and we got plenty of those today. 🩸\n\nSo, the Snessengers take a 1-0 lead in this Best-of-3 series. They showed incredible resilience, especially after that early deficit. The crowd is absolutely losing their minds, chanting and splashing around in the mud. It's a party in Zmeigorod tonight, I can tell you that much!\n\nAs for the Runeguard, they’re facing elimination in the next game. They’ll need more than just goat's milk toasts from **Gurney Fadiman** to turn this around. They need to find a way to stop the Snessengers' high-flying offense and maybe hope for a rockslide to take out the opposition’s bench!\n\nFinal score: **The Zmeigorod Snessengers 4, The Kerlauger Runeguard 2**. A magnificent display of Trollball at its most chaotic! I’ve been Nok the Corrupter, and I’ll be back for Game 2 to see if the Runeguard can keep their playoff dreams alive or if they’ll be cast into the abyss of the off-season! 🎙️✨\n\nDon't forget to pay your tabs at Imra’s bar on the way out, or you might find yourself part of the next ritual sangria! Stay wicked, Osterra!","week":1,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-2-1-kerlauger-zmeigorod","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Lorilee Aldred in zone Center Field","Gurney Fadiman passes the ball to Benjie Foulk!","Rose Kluge tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but Gurney Fadiman blocks it!","Lorilee Aldred tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Shepperd Trefler runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Avaria Revell tries to Tackle Lashondra Niehaus, but Lashondra Niehaus blocks it!","Lon Gabriell runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Benjie Foulk shoots from Away 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Evalyn Pierrepont in zone Center Field","Shepperd Trefler Tackles Alded Sanjay and INJURES THEM!","Shepperd Trefler Tackles Dare Wynnie and INJURES THEM!","Reginauld Cordell tries to Tackle Arni Griffith, but misses!","Gurney Fadiman tries to Tackle Rose Kluge, but misses!","Harilda Sigsmond tries to Tackle Arni Griffith, but misses!","Alded Sanjay tries to Tackle Lashondra Niehaus, but misses!","Kleinstein MacGregor runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Evalyn Pierrepont tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Kleinstein MacGregor tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Kleinstein MacGregor passes the ball to Alded Sanjay, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Reginauld Cordell in zone Home Field","Gere Cordelie tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Vivia Namara tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Dare Wynnie tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Alded Sanjay tries to Tackle Johnna Beetner, but misses!","Benjie Foulk passes the ball to Benjie Foulk!","Lorilee Aldred throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Arni Griffith!","Arni Griffith tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Gere Cordelie tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Alded Sanjay passes the ball to Northway Orran!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Arni Griffith in zone Home Field","Dare Wynnie passes the ball to Northway Orran, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Lashondra Niehaus in zone Home Field","Rose Kluge tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Johnna Beetner shoots from Home Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Gere Cordelie in zone Home Field","Johnna Beetner tries to Tackle Kleinstein MacGregor, but Kleinstein MacGregor blocks it!","Northway Orran tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Vivia Namara tries to Tackle Delija Dowling, but misses!","Rose Kluge shoots from Home Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Evalyn Pierrepont in zone Home Field","Evalyn Pierrepont tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but misses!","Evalyn Pierrepont tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but misses!","Evalyn Pierrepont tries to Tackle Lashondra Niehaus, but misses!","Gere Cordelie passes the ball to Arni Griffith!","Rose Kluge shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Arni Griffith in zone Center Field","Shepperd Trefler Tackles Rose Kluge and INJURES THEM!","Delija Dowling tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Arni Griffith shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Dare Wynnie in zone Center Field","Alded Sanjay shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Gere Cordelie in zone Center Field","Rose Kluge runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Rose Kluge runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Benjie Foulk tries to Tackle Alded Sanjay, but Alded Sanjay blocks it!","Benjie Foulk Tackles Gere Cordelie and INJURES THEM!","Rose Kluge tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
