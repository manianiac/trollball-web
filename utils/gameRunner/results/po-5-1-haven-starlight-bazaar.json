I’m your host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the Temple of Light Compound where the grass is as manicured as a High Prince’s eyebrows! We’re kicking off the Losers Bracket Playoffs, and the atmosphere is thicker than a swamp-troll's hide! The stakes are sky-high, folks; it's a Best of 3 series, and the loser of this set is going straight into the dark, dusty corners of the elimination pile! 🏟️\n\nOn my left, we have the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, fresh off the stilts of the Prismatic Lagoon! I caught a glimpse of Essa Pattie earlier, meticulously sticking a very specific feather into his helmet’s plume. Gagliano Tallbott was seen whispering a terrible joke to the Trollball—apparently, he thinks the leather needs to 'loosen up' before it tastes the dirt! Milo Nelie is over there tracing sigils over his heart, probably praying to some fey spirit that doesn't exist, but golly, it sure looks professional! 🎪\n\nAnd on my right... *sigh*... the Haven Lights. These shiny shield-slickers are playing on their home turf, surrounded by the library and the monastery. Shiroma Salim is obsessively re-taping his Kirkhammer's handle, while Zwart Bunns is actually whispering his secret fears to the ball! How touching! It’s enough to make a demon want to retch if the promise of a broken limb wasn't just minutes away! The Twinlights of Dawn’s Hope and Silver Twilight are shining down, but let’s hope we see some real darkness on the pitch today! 🕯️\n\nIt’s a quiet crowd today, folks—seems the Zmeigorod Snessengers have hogged all the fans again—but don't let the empty seats fool you! These teams are desperate, and desperation is the finest seasoning for a Trollball stew! Grab your snacks and keep your eyes on the goals, because the playoffs wait for no soul! Let’s get to the action! 🍿💥","postGame":"Great galloping gargoyles, what a display of righteous wreckage! The Haven Lights have defended their pristine pitch, but they certainly didn't do it with 'mercy' or 'grace'! They did it with a good old-fashioned beating! The final score stands at 4 to 1 in favor of the Lights, giving them a 1-0 lead in this Best of 3 series! The fans who did show up got a real treat, seeing the Bizarres get bounced around like a sack of turnips! 🦴💥\n\nThe action started hot and heavy in Center Field! Melesa Zelten grabbed that troll head early, but the Haven defense was hungrier than a pack of King Nezmear's werewolves! Farand Keil set the tone by absolutely leveling Willa Lois, sending them straight to the healer’s tent! Not to be outdone, Shiroma Salim—who I’m told is a real 'hero' of the realm—decided Pompei Hephzipa didn't need to be standing anymore and put him on the turf with a sickening thud! 🚑\n\nAnd folks, Tybi Reo was a one-woman wrecking crew in the first half! She lunged out and caught Kristin Kronfeld with a tackle so fierce I could hear the armor buckling from the press box! It’s wonderful to see these temple-dwellers embrace the true spirit of the Everwar—pure, unadulterated violence! Zwart Bunns even got in on the fun, injuring Demp Chet just before the whistle. It was a bloodbath in the middle of the field, and I loved every second of it! 🔨\n\nHalftime came just in time for the Bizarres to scrape their players off the stage-planks. After a quick respawn and some 'Hallowed Ground' healing, we were back at it! But the break didn't change the momentum. Marlane Lounge, looking like a rogue out of Sawyer's own circus, came out swinging and put Bush Heiner out of commission immediately! Then Tybi Reo reminded Gagliano Tallbott that jokes don't win games by knocking him flat on his back! 🤡\n\nThe Bizarres finally found a spark of life when Aggri Cookie went on a tear! He dodged through the white-and-silver line like a greased pig and fired a beautiful pass to Milo Nelie in the End Zone! Milo didn't miss, dunking that head right into the basket for the Bizarres' first—and only—point of the match! A brief moment of glory for the lagoon-dwellers, but alas, it was just a candle in a hurricane! 🕯️💨\n\nThat’s when Marlane Lounge decided to put on a shooting clinic that would make Sir Randy blush! From way back in Center Field, Marlane let fly with a shot that sailed through the air like a guided bolt! **BOOM!** Two points on the board for the Haven Lights! It was a masterpiece of precision, even if it came from a team that probably spends their weekends helping old ladies cross the street. Disgusting, really, but effective! 🎯\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Before the Bizarres could even catch their breath, Riffle Heyde secured possession and the ball found its way back to Marlane. Like a repeat of a nightmare, Lounge stepped up and fired again from the center! **WHAM!** Another 2-point shoot! The Haven Lights' lead ballooned to 4 to 1 faster than Elspeth Ortell can whip up a batch of ritual sangria! The Bizarres' defense was looking more like a wet paper towel than a professional Trollball team! 🍷\n\nI must say, I’m disappointed the Bizarres couldn't pull it together. I was rooting for a bit more chaos from the fey troupe, but they seemed more interested in hitting the dirt than hitting their marks. Kython is going to have some harsh words for his performers after this one! The Haven Lights might act all 'benevolent' like Nikos Thanae, but they showed a real mean streak today that would make Lord Orzalon crack a tiny, terrifying smile. 😈\n\nThe stadium's 'Shield's Watch' was definitely in effect, as the Bazaar's offense seemed to crumble every time they got close to the goal. You could practically feel the judgment radiating from the monastery walls! It’s hard to play ball when you’ve got a thousand years of boring tradition staring you down, isn't it? The Bizarres were outmatched, out-hit, and out-shot from start to finish! ⛪\n\nSo, as the sun sets over the Temple Compound, the Haven Lights take the first game of this playoff series! They’re one step closer to staying alive in the bracket, while the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres are staring into the abyss of the Losers Bracket's loser pile! Can the fey circus bounce back, or will the Lights extinguish their playoff dreams in Game 2? 🌙\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a very bloody, very holy Aegis Field! Remember, in Trollball, if you aren't bleeding, you aren't trying! Stay corrupt, Osterra! We'll see you for the next round of carnage! Goodnight and keep your weapons sharpened! 🎙️💀","week":1,"homeScore":4,"awayScore":1,"slug":"po-2-1-haven-starlight-bazaar","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Melesa Zelten in zone Center Field","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but misses!","Farand Keil Tackles Willa Lois and INJURES THEM!","Demp Chet tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Shiroma Salim Tackles Pompei Hephzipa and INJURES THEM!","Tybi Reo Tackles Kristin Kronfeld and INJURES THEM!","Gagliano Tallbott tries to Tackle Zwart Bunns, but Zwart Bunns blocks it!","Marlane Lounge tries to Tackle Melesa Zelten, but Melesa Zelten blocks it!","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Quintessa Austine, but misses!","Marlane Lounge tries to Tackle Melesa Zelten, but misses!","Shiroma Salim tries to Tackle Milo Nelie, but misses!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Milo Nelie, but misses!","Farand Keil tries to Tackle Quintessa Austine, but Quintessa Austine blocks it!","Shiroma Salim tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but Demp Chet blocks it!","Wieren Ivar tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but Demp Chet blocks it!","Zwart Bunns Tackles Demp Chet and INJURES THEM!","Shiroma Salim tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but Bush Heiner blocks it!","Gagliano Tallbott tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Zwart Bunns tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Aggri Cookie throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Berkin Waters!","Bush Heiner tries to Tackle Wieren Ivar, but Wieren Ivar blocks it!","Aggri Cookie tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but Berkin Waters blocks it!","Berkin Waters throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Zwart Bunns in zone Center Field","Wieren Ivar tries to Tackle Melesa Zelten, but Melesa Zelten blocks it!","Quintessa Austine tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but misses!","Berkin Waters passes the ball to Dickenson Beker!","Gagliano Tallbott Tackles Riffle Heyde and INJURES THEM!","Aggri Cookie tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but misses!","Zwart Bunns runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Milo Nelie in zone Away Field","Melesa Zelten tries to Tackle Dickenson Beker, but Dickenson Beker blocks it!","Quintessa Austine tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but misses!","Marlane Lounge Tackles Bush Heiner and INJURES THEM!","Riffle Heyde tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Tybi Reo Tackles Gagliano Tallbott and INJURES THEM!","Melesa Zelten runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wieren Ivar tries to Tackle Melesa Zelten, but misses!","Marlane Lounge tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but Aggri Cookie blocks it!","Milo Nelie shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Quintessa Austine in zone Center Field","Zwart Bunns tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Melesa Zelten runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Shiroma Salim tries to Tackle Melesa Zelten, but misses!","Quintessa Austine tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Quintessa Austine, but Quintessa Austine blocks it!","Aggri Cookie runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Aggri Cookie passes to Milo Nelie in the End Zone, who dunks the ball into the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Shiroma Salim in zone Center Field","Riffle Heyde tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Aggri Cookie tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but Marlane Lounge blocks it!","Melesa Zelten tries to Tackle Tybi Reo, but Tybi Reo blocks it!","Coward Tarton passes the ball to Riffle Heyde!","Marlane Lounge shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Riffle Heyde in zone Center Field","Milo Nelie tries to Tackle Tybi Reo, but misses!","Riffle Heyde tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Marlane Lounge shoots from Center Field and SCORES!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
