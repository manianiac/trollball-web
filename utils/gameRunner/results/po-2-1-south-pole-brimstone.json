It's a crisp, bone-chilling evening here at the South Pole Palisade, and the atmosphere is thicker than Sir Tanos' head! This is the Losers Bracket, folks—where the stakes are high and the dignity is low! We've got the Brimstone Fire Eaters coming in from the sulfur-stinking ruins of Su'akour to face off against our hosts, the South Pole Yetis, in a Best of 3 that'll leave someone crying in the snow!\\n\\nLook at these Fire Eaters! Nigel Rothmuller is over there whispering rhymes to the clouds like a madman, while Nachison Icken has her boots on the wrong feet again! Talk about a tactical advantage—how can the defense predict your footwork if your feet don't even know where they're going? And over in the Yeti camp, Seiter Aida is taking a deep whiff of some game-worn socks. Now that's what I call a localized toxic hazard! Sale Tocci is braiding her hair tight enough to pop a skull, and Udela Dorkus is literally licking a whetstone. That's the kind of dedication those 'heroes' like Sir Artorias just don't have time for between their fancy galas!\\n\\nThe freezing rain is coming down in sheets, turning this field into a glorious ice rink of pain! The wolf packs are howling in the distance, but they’re nothing compared to the screams we’re expecting on the pitch today. It’s Game 1 of the series, and while the stands might be a little light on fans—I guess everyone's still nursing their hangovers from the Zmeigorod festival—the intensity is absolutely electric! Let’s get ready for some Trollball!","postGame":"What a humdinger of a match, sports fans! The South Pole Palisade has seen some sights tonight, and most of them involve teeth flying across the ice! The Brimstone Fire Eaters have taken Game 1 with a commanding 5-2 victory, leaving the Yetis out in the cold in every sense of the word! The action started fast and furious when Coussoule Bidle found an opening and fired a shot straight into the basket, putting the home team up early. The Yetis were howling, the few fans in the stands were actually waking up, and it looked like a frost-bitten upset was in the making!\\n\\nBut you can't keep a Fire Eater down for long! Wylde Jutta turned into a one-demon wrecking crew, absolute poetry in motion! Jutta laid out Sayers Erdda and then turned right around to put Jessy Debbie into the frozen turf. It was a beautiful display of surgical violence that would make even my boss, Lord Orzalon, crack a smile in his cell! With the Yeti defense looking like a pile of chopped firewood, Glassman Solley took a shot from the home field and buried it! We went into halftime with the score tightening up and the smell of sulfur and sweat filling the sub-zero air.\\n\\nThe second half kicked off with some real grit! Ajit Serge decided he'd had enough of Nigel Rothmuller’s weather predictions and sent him straight to the healer’s tent with a thunderous tackle! But Nigel is a resilient one, isn't he? They came back like a bad penny, charging down the field and dunking that troll head right into the end zone for a spectacular score! It was a real 'in your face' moment for the frozen locals!\\n\\nThe Fire Eaters weren't done yet, oh no! Lowson Hersh showed off some incredible range, launching a shot from the home field that sailed through the air like a guided missile. Two points on the board just like that! The Yetis tried to mount a comeback, with Selima Si showing some late-game fire by taking out Wylde Jutta with a tackle that sounded like a falling glacier, but it was too little, too late!\\n\\nFinal score: Brimstone Fire Eaters 5, South Pole Yetis 2! The Fire Eaters take a 1-0 lead in this best-of-three series, and the Yetis have a lot of soul-searching—and sock-smelling—to do before Game 2. I bet those fancy 'White Ravens' or the pampered 'Haven Lights' wouldn't have lasted five minutes in this freezing sleet! This is real sport, folks! This is the Everwar at its finest!\\n\\nThe stadium was a mess of frozen mud and sulfur fumes, and honestly, the lack of a crowd just meant more room for the echoes of crunching bones! If you're looking for the 'heroes' of the realm, they're probably somewhere warm, drinking tea with Maple, while these warriors are out here losing limbs for our entertainment!\\n\\nRaphael Miyasawa and Seiter Aida certainly had their hands full today. Every time someone hit the ice, it sounded like a dinner bell for the healers! The way the players were sliding around on that icy field, it’s a wonder anyone kept their lunch down, especially with the smell of those Su'akour fumes wafting in from the Fire Eaters' equipment. Bollinger Susette took some hits but kept on ticking, proving that getting punched in the shoulder by a teammate is the breakfast of champions!\\n\\nWe saw some incredible play from Nigel Rothmuller and Lowson Hersh, who really carried the day for the visitors. On the other side, Coussoule Bidle was a bright spot for the Yetis, but they just couldn't handle the sheer physical pressure once the Fire Eaters got their rhythm. The way Duky Orelee was swinging that Kriegsmesser, you'd think he was trying to carve a sculpture out of the opposition!\\n\\nAs we wrap up here in the freezing south, the Brimstone Fire Eaters look like they're ready to eat the world. The Yetis are on the ropes, and if they don't find a way to stop the bleeding—literally—this series is going to be over before the ice melts!\\n\\nSo, keep your eyes peeled and your weapons sharpened, fans! Game 2 is just around the corner, and if it's half as bloody as this one, we're in for a real treat! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most violent place on the plane! See you at the next one, and remember: if it doesn't bleed, it's not Trollball! Stay corrupted, Osterra!","week":1,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":5,"slug":"po-2-1-south-pole-brimstone","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Hilaire Guevara in zone Center Field","Udela Dorkus tries to Tackle Nachison Icken, but Nachison Icken blocks it!","Oona Jane tries to Tackle Selima Si, but misses!","Lowson Hersh Tackles Udela Dorkus and INJURES THEM!","Nigel Rothmuller tries to Tackle Isborne Krause, but misses!","Coussoule Bidle shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Isborne Krause in zone Center Field","Nachison Icken tries to Tackle Sale Tocci, but misses!","Campball Fink Tackles Ajit Serge and INJURES THEM!","Glassman Solley tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but Hilaire Guevara blocks it!","Nachison Icken tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Wylde Jutta Tackles Sayers Erdda and INJURES THEM!","Wylde Jutta Tackles Jessy Debbie and INJURES THEM!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Isborne Krause, but misses!","Nigel Rothmuller tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but Hilaire Guevara blocks it!","Duky Orelee passes the ball to Selima Si!","Duky Orelee shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Bollinger Susette in zone Center Field","Sale Tocci tries to Tackle Orlina Jerrine, but misses!","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Sale Tocci, but misses!","Wylde Jutta Tackles Isborne Krause and INJURES THEM!","Coussoule Bidle Tackles Selimah Tully and INJURES THEM!","Lowson Hersh shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Wylde Jutta in zone Center Field","Campball Fink runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bollinger Susette tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Glassman Solley shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Orlina Jerrine in zone Center Field","Duky Orelee tries to Tackle Orlina Jerrine, but misses!","Nachison Icken runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Wylde Jutta in zone Home Field","Isborne Krause tries to Tackle Nigel Rothmuller, but Nigel Rothmuller blocks it!","Ajit Serge Tackles Nigel Rothmuller and INJURES THEM!","Coussoule Bidle tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Bollinger Susette tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Glassman Solley runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Coussoule Bidle Tackles Orlina Jerrine and INJURES THEM!","Selima Si tries to Tackle Oona Jane, but misses!","Isborne Krause tries to Tackle Glassman Solley, but misses!","Hilaire Guevara tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Campball Fink tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Nigel Rothmuller runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Lowson Hersh in zone Center Field","Campball Fink runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Jessy Debbie tries to Tackle Glassman Solley, but Glassman Solley blocks it!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Sale Tocci, but misses!","Bollinger Susette tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Orlina Jerrine tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Sayers Erdda tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Lowson Hersh shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Nachison Icken in zone Center Field","Duky Orelee tries to Tackle Oona Jane, but misses!","Sayers Erdda tries to Tackle Oona Jane, but misses!","Duky Orelee tries to Tackle Wylde Jutta, but misses!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Coussoule Bidle, but Coussoule Bidle blocks it!","Selima Si Tackles Wylde Jutta and INJURES THEM!","Coussoule Bidle tries to Tackle Bollinger Susette, but Bollinger Susette blocks it!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
