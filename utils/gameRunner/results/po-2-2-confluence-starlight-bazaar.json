THE PLAYOFFS ARE PEAKING! 🎙️\n\nHello, you gorgeous ghouls and gridiron gladiators! It’s your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the magnificent **Glowstone Terrace**! We are high in the World's Spine Mountains for Game 2 of this Winners' Bracket clash! The atmosphere is thinner than a hero’s excuses, and the **Market Day Crowd** is absolutely ravenous for some sanctioned slaughter! The **Confluence Captains** hold a 1-0 series lead, and if they win tonight, they’ll send the Bizarres packing to the losers' bracket faster than a soul entering the Demon Prison! 🏔️👊\n\nI’ve been watching the warm-ups, and let me tell you, the rituals are in full swing! **Ladew Evelina** just finished her third raw egg—shell and all—while **O'Conner Maighdlin** is currently refusing to speak unless it’s in a rhyming couplet. I hope 'goal' rhymes with 'shattering a skull' tonight! On the other side, the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** look a bit jittery. **Demp Chet** has been staring at his reflection in a bucket of water for twenty minutes, and **Milo Nelie** is tracing sigils over his heart like he’s trying to ward off the inevitable. It’s going to take more than magic to survive the **Mountain Wind** and the blinding **Glowstone Glare**! 🥚✨\n\nThe Guild of the Black Sky is out in force today, probably led by that strangely beautiful kissless virgin, Brennen Farno. I hope he brought his checkbook, because the Bizarres are looking to make them pay for that Game 1 blowout! Grab your drinks, folks—the alcohol tolerance on this field is high enough to drain a tavern dry! Let’s get ready for some Trollball! 🏟️🍻","postGame":"### 🏆 THE CAPTAINS CLIMB TO VICTORY! SERIES SWEEP! 🏆\n\nWell, pull my horns and call me a goat, what a finish! The **Confluence Captains** have officially secured their spot in the next round, taking down the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** with a 2-1 victory and sweeping the series 2-0! It wasn't the blowout we saw in Game 1, but it was a masterclass in mountainside grit and Guild-sponsored brutality! The Bizarres fought like cornered rats, but they just couldn't overcome the sheer force of the Captains' defense! 🏔️🎉\n\nThe game started with a frantic scramble in Center Field, with **Demp Chet** snatching up the head early. But folks, the Bizarres' momentum was shorter than a goblin’s temper! The Captains' defense, led by the incomparable **Caves Cestar**, was an absolute fortress. Cestar was reading passes like he was auditing the realm's taxes, snatching a wild pass from **Gagliano Tallbott** right out of the air! It was a beautiful display of theft that would make even Falric the thief jealous! 🧤💎\n\nThen came the hits that make this game great! **Carnahan Laud**—who I saw snacking on dandelions earlier—absolutely pulverized **Aggri Cookie**! I haven't heard a crunch like that since Sir Tanos tried to use his head as a battering ram! The Cookie crumbled, and the Bizarres were already looking thin on the field. But the Captains weren't done! **Ladew Evelina**, fueled by those raw eggs, leveled **Pompei Hephzipa** with a hit that sent him straight to the healer. 🤕💥\n\nPoor **Aggri Cookie** just couldn't catch a break! No sooner had he returned to the field than **Deach Sharlene** sent him right back to the sidelines with another bone-shattering tackle! It’s a wonder the Bizarres had anyone left to carry the ball! Before the half, **Caves Cestar** decided he hadn't done enough damage and took out **Bush Heiner** for good measure. The Bizarres were bleeding out, and the mountain wind was chilling their theatrical bones! 🏥🩹\n\nHalftime allowed the healers to patch up the carnage, but the Captains didn't lose a beat. **Caves Cestar**—the man of the match, surely—intercepted yet another pass, this time from **Quintessa Austine**. The Bizarres' offense was as disorganized as Chairman Riastrad on a vacation! The Captains smelled blood in the thin mountain air and they pounced! 🐺🩸\n\nThe breakthrough finally came from the 2-point zone! **Richia Pazit** found a gap in the chaotic Bizarre defense, squared up, and let it fly! **BOOM!** A 2-point shot that sent the Market Day Crowd into a total frenzy! The Captains took a 2-0 lead, and it looked like the Bizarres were finally headed for the lagoon! 🏀🔥\n\nBut wait! The Bizarres found a spark! **Pompei Hephzipa**, showing more life than a necromancer’s basement, managed to dodge the defense and charge into the End Zone for a spectacular dunk! It was 2-1, and for a moment, the Bizarres looked like they might actually pull off a miracle. Even Kython might have cracked a smile at that one! But hope is a dangerous thing in Osterra, especially when you’re facing the Guild! 🤡✨\n\nThe Captains' defense tightened up like a locked vault. **Belding Chloe** and her armpit-rubbed ball were everywhere, stopping any further advance. The Bizarres tried to push, but they were running into a stone wall. It’s hard to score when you’re constantly being knocked into the Glowstone! 🧱🛑\n\nIn the closing moments, **Ladew Evelina** put the final nail in the coffin by sending **Kristin Kronfeld** to the healer. The Captains stood tall, the final whistle blew, and the Bizarres were officially relegated to the losers' bracket! The Guild of the Black Sky must be laughing all the way to the bank, while the Bizarres are left to tell their terrible jokes to an empty stadium. 🏆👏\n\nWhat a series! The Captains move forward with momentum that could level a mountain, while the Bizarres have to find a way to rebuild their shattered pride. I’m Nok the Corrupter, and I’m going to go find where Cyfnerth the Butcher keeps the celebratory snacks! Stay brutal, Osterra! 💀🔥🎙️","week":2,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":1,"slug":"po-2-2-confluence-starlight-bazaar","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Demp Chet in zone Center Field","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Carnahan Laud, but misses!","Belding Chloe tries to Tackle Gagliano Tallbott, but misses!","Gagliano Tallbott throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Caves Cestar!","Carnahan Laud Tackles Aggri Cookie and INJURES THEM!","Milo Nelie tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Pompei Hephzipa tries to Tackle Ladew Evelina, but misses!","Behl Berstine throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by O'Conner Maighdlin in zone Center Field","Belding Chloe throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Kristin Kronfeld in zone Center Field","Ladew Evelina tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but Demp Chet blocks it!","Belding Chloe tries to Tackle Gagliano Tallbott, but Gagliano Tallbott blocks it!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Ladew Evelina Tackles Pompei Hephzipa and INJURES THEM!","Richia Pazit tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but Bush Heiner blocks it!","Quintessa Austine tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Bush Heiner passes the ball to Gagliano Tallbott!","Deach Sharlene tries to Tackle Quintessa Austine, but misses!","Quintessa Austine runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Deach Sharlene Tackles Aggri Cookie and INJURES THEM!","Vonni Geoff tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but misses!","Ladew Evelina tries to Tackle Bush Heiner, but misses!","Bush Heiner tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Bush Heiner passes the ball to Milo Nelie!","Willa Lois tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Caves Cestar Tackles Bush Heiner and INJURES THEM!","Melesa Zelten runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Pompei Hephzipa in zone Home 2-Point","Richia Pazit tries to Tackle Gagliano Tallbott, but misses!","Demp Chet tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Vonni Geoff tries to Tackle Gagliano Tallbott, but Gagliano Tallbott blocks it!","Vonni Geoff tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but Aggri Cookie blocks it!","Quintessa Austine throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Caves Cestar!","Melesa Zelten tries to Tackle Richia Pazit, but Richia Pazit blocks it!","Milo Nelie tries to Tackle O'Conner Maighdlin, but misses!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to Tackle Pompei Hephzipa, but misses!","Stephan Lisk throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Deach Sharlene in zone Home 2-Point","Vonni Geoff passes the ball to O'Conner Maighdlin!","Melesa Zelten tries to Tackle Carnahan Laud, but misses!","Richia Pazit shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Aggri Cookie in zone Center Field","Milo Nelie passes the ball to Aggri Cookie!","Caves Cestar tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but Demp Chet blocks it!","Deach Sharlene tries to Tackle Aggri Cookie, but misses!","Willa Lois tries to Tackle Vonni Geoff, but misses!","Kristin Kronfeld runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milo Nelie tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Deach Sharlene tries to Tackle Demp Chet, but misses!","Willa Lois runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Belding Chloe tries to Tackle Milo Nelie, but Milo Nelie blocks it!","Pompei Hephzipa runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Demp Chet in zone Center Field","Ladew Evelina Tackles Kristin Kronfeld and INJURES THEM!"],"bracket":"Winners"}
