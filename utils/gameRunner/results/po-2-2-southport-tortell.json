It’s a magnificent, bone-crunching Tuesday night for the greatest sport on any plane of existence! We are live from the perilous, windswept peaks of The Cliffside Pitch in Southport, and let me tell you, the atmosphere is electric! Or maybe that’s just the sea spray hitting the lighthouse! We’re in the thick of the Losers Bracket, Game 2 of a Best of 3, and the stakes are higher than a harpy’s nest! The Tortell Privateers are looking to sweep this series and send the Southport Narwhals to the bottom of the locker—literally! \n\nI just caught a glimpse of the pre-game rituals, and boy, do these athletes have some moxie! Over in the Privateers' camp, Keisling Damalas is currently painting his teeth with charcoal—talk about a winning smile that only a mother or a mortician could love! Meanwhile, Dib Tufts is doing his usual routine of chugging a raw egg, shell and all! That’s the kind of calcium-rich dedication that wins championships, folks! They’re looking to repeat their performance from last week and put the Narwhals out of their misery once and for all. It’s enough to make a demon weep with joy, much like the time Artorias actually did something useful—oh wait, that never happened! \n\nBut don't count out the hometown favorites! The Narwhals are feeling the pressure of being down one-nil. I saw Loralyn Lyndy adjusting her codpiece with theatrical importance, and Braden Gaile is muttering a nonsensical rhyme that sounds like something Sir Tanos would say after one too many glasses of ritual sangria! The gale-force winds are howling, the rocks are sharp, and the sea spray is making the field as slippery as a deal with a money priest! If my Ebon Gate Corruptors were here, they’d be feasting on the chaos, but since they aren't, I’m rooting for the team that causes the most dental damage! Let’s get to the ball!","postGame":"Wowsers! What a frantic, blood-soaked finale we just witnessed! The Tortell Privateers have done it! They’ve swept the series 2-0, leaving the Southport Narwhals gasping for air like a fish out of water on these rocky outcroppings! It was a 4-2 victory in a heart-pounding overtime session that had me gripping my microphone tighter than a warlock grips a cursed soul! The action was hotter than a furnace in the Demon Prison, and twice as loud! \n\nThe Privateers didn’t waste any time making their presence felt. Dib Tufts snatched the ball right out of the gate, and before the Narwhals could even finish their heroic backstories, Melisande Eustacia launched a magnificent shot from the 2-point zone and found nothing but the bottom of the basket! Talk about a dagger to the heart! It was a beautiful display of skill that would make those stuffy Haven Lights turn even paler with envy! \n\nThe Narwhals tried to fight back through the gale-force winds, but the Cliffside Pitch was a cruel mistress today. Loralyn Lyndy missed a desperation shot that sailed wide enough to hit a passing seagull! However, the momentum shifted when Cilurzo Sochor, probably inspired by his own heroic backstory, stepped up in center field and hammered home a scoring shot to tie this puppy up! The crowd—well, the few tourists who weren't terrified of falling off the cliff—went absolutely bananas! \n\nNow, let's talk about the real meat of the game: the violence! Goldberg Tova, a real powerhouse for the Privateers, absolutely laid the wood on Blood Eppes, sending him to see Healer Sand Denys with a collection of new and exciting bruises! Not to be outdone, Fineman Dolhenty of the Narwhals retaliated by crunching Castorina Gies into the turf! It was a symphony of snaps, crackles, and pops that was music to my ears, much better than any of that fancy 'Tree Tea' music Maple likes to play! \n\nAs the clock ticked down, the desperation was palpable. We saw more failed tackles than Sir Randy has arrows! Braden Gaile and Malcolm Goer were trying to advance, but the Privateer defense was as stubborn as a Door-enjoying Chairman! The game headed into Overtime, and you could hear a pin drop if it weren't for the roaring ocean and the sound of Keisling Damalas’s charcoal-covered teeth gnashing in anticipation! \n\nIn the extra period, it was a total scramble! Dib Tufts tried a wild pass that was snatched out of the air by Braden Gaile—a heroic interception if I ever saw one, but we all know heroes usually end up facedown in the muck! Sure enough, the momentum flipped again when Loralee Sunny played the thief and intercepted a return pass right back! It was back-and-forth madness that had the players looking more dizzy than a drunk pirate at Imra’s open bar! \n\nThe Narwhals’ defense eventually cracked under the pressure. Braden Gaile, apparently tired of playing nice, absolutely trucked Melisande Eustacia, taking him out of the play, but it wasn't enough to stop the inevitable tide! The Privateers kept their cool despite the spray and the wind, and the ball found its way into the hands of Kidder Starkey. \n\nWith the game on the line and the series hanging in the balance, Kidder Starkey stood tall in the 2-point zone. He thanked his armor one last time, ignored the sea spray in his eyes, and let it fly! SWISH! A 2-pointer to end it all! The Privateers bench cleared, the Narwhals collapsed in despair, and I almost spilled my drink in excitement! \n\nSo, the series ends 2-0 in favor of the Tortell Privateers! They move on, while the Southport Narwhals are left to lick their wounds and perhaps file a few more fingernails for next season! It was a masterclass in playoff grit, a real display of why we love this game—the hits, the drama, and the delicious, delicious failure of those who try to play the hero! \n\nI haven't seen this much disappointment in Southport since the last time Nezmear tried to explain the difference between a werewolf and a werecow! If you’re looking for the Narwhals, you can probably find them at the bottom of the cliff or drownng their sorrows in whatever rotgut they serve at the lighthouse. As for the Privateers, they’re sailing high on this victory! \n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most dangerous field in Osterra! Remember, folks: life is short, but the Everwar is forever, and Trollball is the only thing that makes it worth living! Stay brutal, stay bloody, and I'll see you next Tuesday for more carnage! Goodnight, you beautiful monsters!","week":2,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-2-2-southport-tortell","plays":["HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Dib Tufts in zone Home 2-Point","Torey Dannye tries to Tackle Loralee Sunny, but Loralee Sunny blocks it!","Fineman Dolhenty tries to Tackle Payson Jan, but Payson Jan blocks it!","Melisande Eustacia shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Blood Eppes in zone Center Field","Loralyn Lyndy shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Castorina Gies in zone Center Field","Castorina Gies shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Torey Dannye in zone Center Field","Goldberg Tova Tackles Blood Eppes and INJURES THEM!","Dib Tufts tries to Tackle Torey Dannye, but misses!","Cilurzo Sochor shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Payson Jan in zone Center Field","Melisande Eustacia shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Braden Gaile in zone Center Field","Malcolm Goer runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Castorina Gies tries to Tackle Cibis Areta, but misses!","Keisling Damalas tries to Tackle Blanc Fantasia, but misses!","Loralyn Lyndy tries to Tackle Dib Tufts, but misses!","Keisling Damalas tries to Tackle Crescint Sonia, but misses!","Kidder Starkey tries to Tackle Crescint Sonia, but Crescint Sonia blocks it!","Keisling Damalas tries to Tackle Cibis Areta, but Cibis Areta blocks it!","Ellan Elburt tries to Tackle Loralyn Lyndy, but misses!","Dib Tufts tries to Tackle Crescint Sonia, but misses!","Fineman Dolhenty passes the ball to Loralyn Lyndy, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Castorina Gies in zone Away Field","Blanc Fantasia tries to Tackle Goldberg Tova, but Goldberg Tova blocks it!","Fineman Dolhenty Tackles Castorina Gies and INJURES THEM!","Ellan Elburt shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","OVERTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Ellan Elburt in zone Away Field","Ellan Elburt runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Dib Tufts throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Braden Gaile!","Malcolm Goer runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Goldberg Tova tries to Tackle Fineman Dolhenty, but misses!","Blood Eppes passes the ball to Cibis Areta, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Kidder Starkey in zone Away Field","Blanc Fantasia tries to Tackle Goldberg Tova, but Goldberg Tova blocks it!","Ellan Elburt shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Torey Dannye in zone Away Field","Goldberg Tova Tackles Torey Dannye and INJURES THEM!","Blanc Fantasia runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Loralee Sunny tries to Tackle Braden Gaile, but misses!","Goldberg Tova tries to Tackle Cilurzo Sochor, but Cilurzo Sochor blocks it!","Braden Gaile throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Loralee Sunny!","Payson Jan shoots from Away 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Kidder Starkey in zone Away 2-Point","Loralyn Lyndy tries to Tackle Goldberg Tova, but Goldberg Tova blocks it!","Loralyn Lyndy tries to Tackle Loralee Sunny, but Loralee Sunny blocks it!","Blood Eppes tries to Tackle Melisande Eustacia, but misses!","Braden Gaile Tackles Melisande Eustacia and INJURES THEM!","Cibis Areta tries to Tackle Keisling Damalas, but misses!","Kidder Starkey shoots from Away 2-Point and SCORES!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
