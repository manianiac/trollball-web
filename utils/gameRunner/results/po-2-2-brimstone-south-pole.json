This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live and loud from the Su'akour Bowl! We are in the thick of the Losers Bracket playoffs, and let me tell you, the stakes are higher than a Warlock's ego! It’s Game 2 of this Best of 3 series, and the tension is so thick you could carve it with a Kriegsmesser! After the Brimstone Fire Eaters marched into the frozen south and snatched a victory last week, the South Pole Yetis are back and they look absolutely famished for a win—or maybe just a fresh pair of socks!\n\nSpeaking of socks, I caught Seiter Aida in the tunnel taking a deep, soulful whiff of their game-worn footwear! If that doesn't clear the sinuses and prep you for a massacre, I don't know what will! On the other side of the pitch, the Fire Eaters are leaning into their home-field advantage. Orlina Jerrine is currently attempting to communicate with a sulfur-stained crow—let’s hope the bird has better tactical advice than the Haven Lights ever do! And look at Glassman Solley, scrubbing his hands with the local Brimstone dirt. That’s the kind of grit the 'heroes' like Sir Artorias only dream about while they're polishing their shiny, useless armor!\n\nWe’re inside the crumbling walls of Su'akour's fortress, and the noxious fumes from the nearby sulfur marshes are really starting to kick in. It’s a beautiful day for some carnage! The ground is uneven, the stands are literally falling apart, and the popularity of these teams is... well, let's just say the fans who did show up are either very brave or very drunk! Since we've got an open bar tonight, I expect the cheering to be just as slurred as it is loud! If you're a fan of The Brimstone Fire Eaters, you're probably used to the smell, but for the Yetis, this place is a literal breath of fresh—well, toxic—air! Let’s get to the action before the stadium collapses!","postGame":"Jumpin' Jehosaphat! What a reversal of fortune we just witnessed here at the Su'akour Bowl! The South Pole Yetis didn't just survive the sulfur fumes; they thrived in them, shutting out the Brimstone Fire Eaters with a clinical 3-0 victory! It was a masterpiece of violence and coordination that has tied this Best of 3 series up at one game apiece! The 'heroes' of the realm could learn a thing or two about resilience from these frost-bitten warriors, though I'm sure someone like Sir Tanos is too busy hating letters to appreciate the fine art of a leather troll head being dunked!\n\nThe match started with a frantic scramble in the Center Field, where Duky Orelee snatched up the ball like a demon claiming a soul! The Yetis weren't playing around today. Even when Selimah Tully tried to dampen the mood by injuring Udela Dorkus early on, the Yetis just gritted their teeth and pushed forward. It was a beautiful sight to see Jessy Debbie weaving through the defense, dodging the Voulge of Wylde Jutta like it was a mere toothpick. The coordination was divine—or should I say, demonic!\n\nThe first breakthrough came when Udela Dorkus, recovered and ready for revenge, delivered a pinpoint pass to Jessy Debbie right in the End Zone! Debbie didn't just score; they dunked that troll head into the basket with enough force to make the crumbling walls of this stadium shake! It was a statement play that hushed the rowdy, soot-covered Brimstone fans. You could almost hear the sound of the 'heroes' sighing in relief that they weren't on the receiving end of that thunderous dunk!\n\nBut the Yetis weren't done! Selima Si, wearing those garishly colored undergarments for luck, showed everyone why she’s a force to be reckoned with. After dodging a tackle from Lowson Hersh that would have leveled a smaller player, she lined up a shot from the 2-point zone. The ball sailed through the sulfur-thick air and found nothing but the bottom of the goal! Two points just like that! The Fire Eaters looked like they were stuck in the mud—literally, the uneven ground here is a nightmare for anyone not wearing Yeti-sized boots!\n\nAs we hit halftime, the score sat at a lopsided 3-0. The open bar was clearly taking its toll on the players and the fans alike. I saw Bollinger Susette trying to tackle his own shadow, and I’m fairly certain the referee was blessing a flask instead of a weapon! The Fire Eaters tried to regroup, but the noxious fumes seemed to be working against the home team for once. Maybe they inhaled a bit too much of the sulfur marshes before the whistle blew?\n\nThe second half was a absolute showcase of brutality! The Brimstone Fire Eaters came out swinging, and I do mean swinging! Lowson Hersh and Glassman Solley turned the pitch into a butcher shop, systematically taking out the Yeti lineup. Hilaire Guevara, Sale Tocci, and Coussoule Bidle were all sent to see Raphael Miyasawa in the healer's tent in rapid succession! It was a glorious display of the 'fighting' part of Trollball that keeps us all coming back for more!\n\nDespite the carnage, the Fire Eaters couldn't find the basket. Wylde Jutta and Oona Jane took shots that went wide enough to hit the crumbling fortress walls instead of the goal. It was a comedy of errors for the home team! Even when Lowson Hersh managed a spectacular interception, snatching a wild pass from Jessy Debbie out of the air, the Fire Eaters just couldn't capitalize. They were running around like headless chickens—which, coincidentally, is what I imagine Sir Artorias looks like without his helmet!\n\nOne of the most impressive moments was seeing the Yetis' defense hold strong even while undermanned. Isborne Krause was a brick wall, blocking everything the Fire Eaters threw at him. Every time Nachison Icken or Orlina Jerrine tried to make a run for the goal, they were met with a wall of cold, hard Yeti muscle. It’s a wonder anyone is still standing after the amount of punishment handed out in that second half!\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the scoreboard told the story: South Pole Yetis 3, Brimstone Fire Eaters 0. A total shutout! The Fire Eaters might have won the injury count, but the Yetis won the game and saved their playoff lives! The series is tied, and we are headed to a decisive Game 3! I hope the healers have plenty of bandages and the bar has plenty of ale, because someone is going home next week, and it isn't going to be pretty!\n\nSo, grab your clubs and polish your daggers, folks! The Yetis have proven they can handle the heat, and the Fire Eaters are going to be looking for blood in the tiebreaker. This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the Su'akour Bowl. Remember, in Trollball, if you aren't bleeding, you aren't trying hard enough! See you at the finale, Osterra!","week":2,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":3,"slug":"po-2-2-brimstone-south-pole","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Duky Orelee in zone Center Field","Sayers Erdda tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Selimah Tully Tackles Udela Dorkus and INJURES THEM!","Selima Si runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Selima Si, but Selima Si blocks it!","Oona Jane tries to Tackle Jessy Debbie, but Jessy Debbie blocks it!","Orlina Jerrine tries to Tackle Duky Orelee, but misses!","Campball Fink tries to Tackle Sayers Erdda, but misses!","Jessy Debbie runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wylde Jutta tries to Tackle Jessy Debbie, but Jessy Debbie blocks it!","Sale Tocci shoots from Home 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Isborne Krause in zone Home 2-Point","Udela Dorkus passes to Jessy Debbie in the End Zone, who dunks the ball into the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Hilaire Guevara in zone Center Field","Jessy Debbie runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Ajit Serge, but misses!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Ajit Serge, but Ajit Serge blocks it!","Sale Tocci runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Hilaire Guevara shoots from Home 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Glassman Solley in zone Home 2-Point","Isborne Krause tries to Tackle Glassman Solley, but misses!","Wylde Jutta runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Isborne Krause tries to Tackle Oona Jane, but misses!","Campball Fink passes the ball to Glassman Solley, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Sayers Erdda in zone Home Field","Sayers Erdda runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Selima Si shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Jessy Debbie in zone Center Field","Sale Tocci runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wylde Jutta tries to Tackle Ajit Serge, but Ajit Serge blocks it!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Orlina Jerrine in zone Home Field","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but Hilaire Guevara blocks it!","Wylde Jutta shoots from Home Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Isborne Krause in zone Home Field","Lowson Hersh Tackles Hilaire Guevara and INJURES THEM!","Glassman Solley Tackles Sale Tocci and INJURES THEM!","Selimah Tully tries to Tackle Isborne Krause, but Isborne Krause blocks it!","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Coussoule Bidle, but Coussoule Bidle blocks it!","Selimah Tully Tackles Coussoule Bidle and INJURES THEM!","Campball Fink tries to Tackle Udela Dorkus, but misses!","Jessy Debbie passes the ball to Udela Dorkus!","Selima Si tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Jessy Debbie throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Lowson Hersh!","Nachison Icken runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wylde Jutta Tackles Udela Dorkus and INJURES THEM!","Oona Jane shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Oona Jane in zone Center Field","Glassman Solley tries to Tackle Sayers Erdda, but misses!","Wylde Jutta runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Glassman Solley shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Bollinger Susette in zone Away Field","Lowson Hersh runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Ajit Serge tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Lowson Hersh tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Glassman Solley shoots from Away 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Oona Jane in zone Away 2-Point","Isborne Krause tries to Tackle Selimah Tully, but misses!","Orlina Jerrine tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Nachison Icken tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
