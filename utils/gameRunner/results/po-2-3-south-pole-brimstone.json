This is Nok the Corrupter, the voice of Tuesday Night Trollball, coming to you live from the soot-stained ruins of the Su'akour Bowl! 🎙️ We are at a fever pitch tonight, folks, because this is Game 3 of the Losers Bracket Playoffs! It’s all or nothing, win or go home to a cold meal and a lecture from a 'hero'! The Brimstone Fire Eaters and the South Pole Yetis have split the first two games, and tonight we decide who stays in the dance and who gets tossed out like yesterday’s garbage! \n\nThe atmosphere here is thick enough to choke a dragon, thanks to the Su'akour sulfur marshes wafting those lovely noxious fumes right over the pitch! 💨 I see Nigel Rothmuller over there muttering folk rhymes to the smog—let's hope the clouds have good tactical advice! Meanwhile, the Yetis are looking a bit out of their element in the heat. Ajit Serge is standing perfectly still, listening to the wind for a sign. Personally, I think the only sign he'll get is a spiked gauntlet to the jaw, but that’s why we love the game! \n\nThe popularity for these two might be lower than Sir Tanos' respect for the written word, especially compared to those Zmeigorod darlings, but the intensity is unmatched! The open bar is already flowing, and the fans—the few who can stand the smell—are getting rowdy! We’ve got players wiping sweat on each other, licking whetstones, and getting punched by teammates just to wake up! This is real sport, not like those pampered Haven Lights playing tag in their shiny meadows! Let’s get ready for some carnage! 💥","postGame":"Jumpin' Jehosaphat, what a way to close out a series! The Brimstone Fire Eaters have defended their crumbling fortress with a 3-0 victory, clinching the series 2-1 and moving on in the playoffs! 🏆 The South Pole Yetis put up a fight, but they’re heading back to the icebox tonight with nothing but bruises and the smell of sulfur to remember us by! \n\nThe action was hotter than a demon’s furnace right out of the gate! Nigel Rothmuller, the master of folk rhymes, proved that poetry and violence go hand-in-hand! They charged through the center field, dodged the freezing breath of the defense, and slammed that troll head right into the End Zone for a spectacular dunk! 🏀 The Fire Eaters took a 1-0 lead, and the crumbling walls of the Bowl nearly gave way from the roar of the drunken crowd! \n\nBut you can't have a Trollball match without some medical emergencies, can you? Hilaire Guevara absolutely flattened Wylde Jutta early on, sending them straight to the healer’s tent! It was a hit so hard I’m surprised Sir Artorias didn't feel it in his fancy palace! But the Fire Eaters gave it right back. Oona Jane and Nachison Icken turned into a two-person wrecking crew, laying out Ajit Serge and Coussoule Bidle in rapid succession! Talk about surgical violence! ⚔️\n\nBy the time we reached halftime, the pitch looked more like a battlefield from the Everwar than a ball field! With the open bar in full swing, I’m fairly certain the players were seeing three troll heads instead of one! Bollinger Susette was swinging his hatchet at shadows, and I saw Isborne Krause try to tackle a crumbling wall! The fumes and the booze are a dangerous mix, folks, but it makes for one heck of a show! \n\nIn the second half, the Yetis tried to mount a comeback, but the Fire Eater defense was as solid as the black stone of Su'akour! Duky Orelee did his best to turn the tide, sending Nigel Rothmuller to the dirt with a tackle that sounded like a falling glacier. But the Fire Eaters have grit! Even when the legendary Lowson Hersh was taken out by Sayers Erdda, the Brimstone squad didn't blink an eye! \n\nThe nail in the coffin came from the veteran Selimah Tully! After asking the ref to bless his dagger—which I'm sure was a total violation of several rules I don't care about—he found himself in the Home 2-Point zone. He let that troll head fly, and it sailed through the sulfur-thick air like a guided missile, right through the hoop! 🎯 Two points on the board and the series was practically over! \n\nThe Yetis started fumbling like a bunch of 'heroes' trying to work a real job. Jessy Debbie tried to pass the ball, but I think the bacon grease from their boot-polishing ritual finally caught up to them because that ball slipped away like a greased pig! Possession swapped back to Nigel Rothmuller, and the Yetis could only watch as the clock ticked down on their playoff dreams. \n\nFinal score: Brimstone Fire Eaters 3, South Pole Yetis 0! The Fire Eaters take the series 2-1! It was a masterclass in using the environment; those noxious fumes and uneven ground really played havoc with the southern visitors. Raphael Miyasawa certainly earned her keep today, patching up more holes than a poor man's trousers! \n\nI’ve got to give a shout-out to my favorites, the Ebon Gate Corruptors—they’d have loved the smell of this place! As for the South Pole Yetis, they fought hard, but maybe next time they should spend less time smelling their own socks and more time practicing their aim! They’re headed to the lower bracket, and I hope they brought some warm blankets for the trip! \n\nWhat a night, Osterra! We saw dunks, we saw shots, and we saw enough blood to satisfy a vampire’s weekend plans! If you’re looking for the 'heroes' of the realm, check the local tea house, because the real warriors were right here in the mud! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the Su'akour Bowl! Keep your weapons sharp and your drinks stiff! See you at the next one! 🍻🔥","week":3,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":3,"slug":"po-2-3-south-pole-brimstone","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Oona Jane in zone Center Field","Campball Fink tries to Tackle Ajit Serge, but misses!","Lowson Hersh tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Oona Jane runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Oona Jane tries to Tackle Coussoule Bidle, but Coussoule Bidle blocks it!","Coussoule Bidle tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Coussoule Bidle tries to Tackle Orlina Jerrine, but misses!","Sayers Erdda tries to Tackle Nigel Rothmuller, but Nigel Rothmuller blocks it!","Nigel Rothmuller passes the ball to Nigel Rothmuller!","Oona Jane runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Sale Tocci tries to Tackle Wylde Jutta, but misses!","Glassman Solley tries to Tackle Duky Orelee, but misses!","Coussoule Bidle tries to Tackle Campball Fink, but misses!","Glassman Solley tries to Tackle Coussoule Bidle, but Coussoule Bidle blocks it!","Wylde Jutta tries to Tackle Jessy Debbie, but Jessy Debbie blocks it!","Hilaire Guevara Tackles Wylde Jutta and INJURES THEM!","Selima Si tries to Tackle Lowson Hersh, but misses!","Nigel Rothmuller runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Selima Si in zone Center Field","Selimah Tully tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Sale Tocci runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Isborne Krause, but misses!","Oona Jane Tackles Ajit Serge and INJURES THEM!","Nachison Icken Tackles Coussoule Bidle and INJURES THEM!","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Nigel Rothmuller tries to Tackle Isborne Krause, but misses!","Campball Fink tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but Hilaire Guevara blocks it!","Isborne Krause throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Selima Si in zone Away Field","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Nachison Icken in zone Away Field","Oona Jane runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Selimah Tully tries to Tackle Jessy Debbie, but misses!","Sayers Erdda tries to Tackle Nachison Icken, but misses!","Glassman Solley tries to Tackle Sale Tocci, but misses!","Duky Orelee Tackles Nigel Rothmuller and INJURES THEM!","Duky Orelee tries to Tackle Campball Fink, but Campball Fink blocks it!","Selimah Tully runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Jessy Debbie tries to Tackle Selimah Tully, but misses!","Lowson Hersh tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Duky Orelee tries to Tackle Wylde Jutta, but misses!","Lowson Hersh Tackles Ajit Serge and INJURES THEM!","Lowson Hersh runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Selimah Tully shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Sale Tocci in zone Center Field","Sayers Erdda runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Orlina Jerrine tries to Tackle Coussoule Bidle, but Coussoule Bidle blocks it!","Sayers Erdda runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bollinger Susette tries to Tackle Hilaire Guevara, but misses!","Nachison Icken Tackles Hilaire Guevara and INJURES THEM!","Jessy Debbie passes the ball to Sayers Erdda, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Nigel Rothmuller in zone Away 2-Point","Sale Tocci tries to Tackle Nigel Rothmuller, but misses!","Oona Jane runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Sayers Erdda Tackles Lowson Hersh and INJURES THEM!","Campball Fink passes the ball to Nigel Rothmuller!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
