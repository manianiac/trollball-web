Nok the Corrupter here, coming to you live from the pristine, almost sickeningly clean Aegis Field in Haven! 🏟️ We are deep in the Winners' Bracket for Game Two of this Best of Three series, and the pressure is higher than a Warlock's bar tab! The Haven Lights took the first game on the road, leaving those New Monteforte Chaos Creatures with their backs against the monastery wall! You can feel the playoff tension in the air—or maybe that's just the 'Twinlight's Glow' giving me a nasty case of the itch! 🕯️\n\nThe Chaos Creatures have been seen doing some truly bizarre prep work to shake off that Game One loss. Lian Denton is currently downing a shot of hot gravy from a dented tin cup—now that's a breakfast of champions, folks! ☕ Meanwhile, Alben Diantha is dipping his hands into a bucket of ice-cold well water. I suppose he wants to make sure his knuckles are nice and numb for the facial reconstructions he's about to perform! It’s all about focus and grit when you’re facing elimination from the Winners' side of the bracket!\n\nAs for the home-team heroes, the Haven Lights are acting like they’ve already won the series. Look at Shiroma Salim over there, obsessively re-taping his shield handle. It’s a temple compound, Salim, not a beauty pageant! 🛡️ And Tybi Reo is busy drawing a diagram of a troll’s head that looks more like a lumpy potato. I hope for their sake they play better than they draw, because the Monteforte crew didn't come here to pray—they came to play, and they brought weapons! Let's get this show on the road! 💥","postGame":"Holy Mackerel, what a total whitewash! Nok the Corrupter here, and I am absolutely delighted to report that the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures just marched into the Temple of Light and turned the lights out on the Haven home crowd! 🕯️❌ A 4 to 0 shutout in Game Two! Those 'heroes' of Haven looked like they were running through molasses while the Chaos Creatures were running through skulls! This series is all tied up at one apiece, and boy oh boy, the momentum has shifted faster than Sir Tanos can lose his temper! ⚾\n\nThe carnage started early when Placido Kora absolutely leveled Riffle Heyde in Center Field, sending a clear message: the Hallowed Ground won't protect you from a Seax to the ribs! 🔪 The Chaos Creatures weren't just here to fight, though. Tucker Hett showed off some real professional-grade aim, launching the Trollball from Center Field for a two-point shoot that silenced the monastery faster than a vow of silence! That put the Creatures up 2-0 and they never looked back!\n\nI have to say, the defense from Monteforte was simply superb. Gabriele Klehm was a one-woman wrecking crew, blocking tackles from Berkin Waters and Tybi Reo like she was swiping away flies at a summer picnic! 🛡️ She even managed to intercept a wild pass from Dickenson Beker. It's almost embarrassing to watch the Lights struggle in their own backyard. I bet Governor-King Zenku is hiding his face even more than usual after seeing this display!\n\nThe middle of the game was a beautiful symphony of violence. We had players being carted off the field so fast the healers couldn't keep up! We saw Raouf Dragone and Boulanger Procto take some heavy hits, but they gave as good as they got. At one point, the officials almost had to stop the game because there were too few players left standing! That's what I call a playoff atmosphere, folks! If you aren't bleeding, you aren't trying! 🩸\n\nFogel Raynold really put the nail in the coffin in the second half. He went on a magnificent run, dodging the Haven defense like he was avoiding a debt collector, and slammed the Trollball into the end zone for a thunderous dunk! 🏀 That made it 3-0, and the Chaos fans who traveled to Haven were starting a riot that even the 'Shield's Watch' couldn't contain! It was poetry in motion, if poetry involved horseman's picks and broken teeth!\n\nAnd let's not forget Placido Kora! She wasn't satisfied with just hurting people; she wanted the glory! She snagged the ball and sprinted into the end zone for the final dunk of the game, bringing the score to a commanding 4-0. The Haven Lights were left chasing shadows, or maybe they were just distracted by the street performers who somehow wandered onto the pitch! 🤡 It was a total breakdown of order for the 'holy' team!\n\nThe Haven Lights’ offense was, quite frankly, a joke. Every time they tried to get something going, they either dropped the ball or got tackled into the next reality. Zwart Bunns tried a few runs, but he was stopped cold by the Monteforte wall. Even Coward Tarton couldn't find a way through. It seems their 'luckstones' weren't doing much against the raw, unadulterated chaos of New Monteforte today!\n\nBy the final whistle, the Aegis Field looked more like a battlefield than a training ground. The 'Twinlight's Glow' was probably flickering in shame! I haven't seen a shutout this satisfying since the last time I watched Sir Artorias try to dance! 💃 The Chaos Creatures have forced a Game Three, and they've done it by playing the meanest, toughest ball I've seen all season. They didn't just win; they dominated every inch of that pristine grass!\n\nI'm hearing reports that the New Monteforte district is already celebrating with a series of small, controlled fires. The crowd at the Unruly Yard must be going wild! Meanwhile, here in Haven, it's so quiet you could hear a mace drop. The 'heroes' are going to have to do a lot of praying if they want to survive the deciding Game Three. I'd recommend they try drinking some of that gravy Lian Denton likes so much—it clearly works better than holy water! ☕\n\nSo there you have it! The Chaos Creatures tie the series! 4-0 is your final score! This is Nok the Corrupter, wishing I could stay and watch the Lights cry in their library, but I've got to go find a celebratory drink! Stay brutal, Osterra! Game Three is going to be a real bone-shaker! 🎙️😈","week":2,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-2-2-haven-new-monteforte","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Shiroma Salim in zone Center Field","Riffle Heyde runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Zwart Bunns throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Away Field","Placido Kora Tackles Riffle Heyde and INJURES THEM!","Alben Diantha throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Away Field","Fogel Raynold tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Gabriele Klehm runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Marlane Lounge Tackles Raouf Dragone and INJURES THEM!","Coward Tarton Tackles Boulanger Procto and INJURES THEM!","Zwart Bunns tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Tucker Hett tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Berkin Waters tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Raouf Dragone passes the ball to Raouf Dragone!","Wolbrom Ariella passes the ball to Wolbrom Ariella!","Tybi Reo tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Alben Diantha throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Marlane Lounge in zone Center Field","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Coward Tarton, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Marlane Lounge, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Berkin Waters, but Berkin Waters blocks it!","Farand Keil throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Mouldon Earl!","Dickenson Beker tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Tucker Hett shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Zwart Bunns, but Zwart Bunns blocks it!","Riffle Heyde tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Riffle Heyde Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","HALFTIME -
