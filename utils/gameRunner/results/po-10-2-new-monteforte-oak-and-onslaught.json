GAME TWO IS ON THE AIR! ⚾\n\nHello, you beautiful, bloodthirsty bunch! It's your favorite voice of the void, Nok the Corrupter, bringing you the second installment of this history-making Best of 5 series! We are live at **The Unruly Yard** in New Monteforte, and let me tell you, the atmosphere is more volatile than a warlock with a hangover! The Chaos Creatures shocked the world in Game One, and now the Wardens are looking to stop the bleeding! 🏟️\n\nI just peeked into the dugouts, and the rituals are in full swing! **Ema Ulrick** of Oak & Onslaught is meticulously putting on her left gauntlet before the right—consistency is key when you're trying to crush skulls, folks! Meanwhile, for the home team, **Lian Denton** is currently downing a shot of steaming hot gravy from a dented tin cup. That’s the kind of high-octane fuel that turns a healer into a herald of havoc! ☕🥓\n\nThe popularity contest is heavily skewed toward the \"heroic\" leafy brigade of Oak & Onslaught, but here in the Unruly Yard, the graffiti is fresh and the crowd is hostile! We've got an **Open Bar** tonight, which means the fans are already swaying like the unstable scaffolding holding up the VIP boxes. I saw **Sir Randy** polishing his fancy bow earlier; I hope he brought an umbrella for the inevitable rain of beer and teeth! 🍻🏹\n\nWill the Chaos Creatures keep the momentum, or will the Wardens find their footing in this rebellious district? The series stands at 1-0 for Monteforte. If the creatures win this, the Wardens will be in a hole deeper than the one **Hole Bowerman** digs for her helmet! Let’s get to the action! 🔥🏈","postGame":"# 🏆 THE OAK CRASHES DOWN ON NEW MONTEFORTE! 🏆\n\nHoly Mackerel, sports fans! What a display of absolute, unmitigated savagery! You’re listening to Nok the Corrupter, and my demonic heart is practically singing after that performance! Oak & Onslaught have roared back with a vengeance, silencing the Unruly Yard with a crushing 4-1 victory! The series is now deadlocked at one game apiece! 🏟️✨\n\nThe game started with **Ema Ulrick** scooping up the troll head in Center Field, but the Chaos Creatures weren't about to play nice. **Urata Oriana** delivered a tackle to Symer Crissy that sounded like a dry branch snapping under a giant's boot! Symer was hauled off to the healers before the game even had its legs! Talk about a warm Monteforte welcome! 🚑\n\nThe violence didn't stop there! **Wolbrom Ariella**—the scythe-wielding shanty singer—decided **Hole Bowerman** didn't need a functioning ribcage, delivering a tackle that sent the Warden lancer straight to the injury list! My goodness, the medical staff is earning their gold tonight, especially with the **Open Bar** making everyone’s aim a little... adventurous! 🍺💥\n\nBut then, the momentum shifted! **Affra Yanaton** found herself in Center Field with a clear line of sight. She didn't run; she launched a prayer! The trollball sailed through the smoky air of the Yard and—SWISH—a massive **2-point Shoot**! Just like that, the Wardens took the lead, and the rowdy crowd went silent enough to hear a rogue's heartbeat! 🎯\n\nThe second half was a literal parade of stretchers! **Placido Kora** leveled Millham Evangeline, but the Chaos Creatures couldn't find the basket. Then, **Boulanger Procto** went on a absolute rampage! He delivered a crunching tackle to **Normi Glaudia** and followed it up by flattening **Teria Ravo**! The injury report is starting to look like a census of the local cemetery! 🏥🔨\n\nDespite the Chaos pressure, the Wardens’ luck held firm. **Abner Seidel**, likely fueled by those garish undergarments of his, found a pocket of space in the Home Field. He didn't hesitate, launching another long-range bomb! Another **2-point Shoot**! The scoreboard lit up 4-0, and the Monteforte rebels looked like they’d just been told they had to pay taxes! 😱🏀\n\nI have to mention the state of the players—with the open bar flowing, **Wolbrom Ariella** threw a pass so wild it nearly took out a street performer on the sidelines! The ball was rolling around the mud like a greasy pig until **Symer Crissy** managed to scoop it back up. The drunkenness on the field is starting to rival a post-victory party at **Yarp's** casino! 🍺🥴\n\nThe Chaos Creatures finally found a silver lining late in the match. **Gabriele Klehm**, the ball-kissing staff-wielder, made a break for it. She navigated the unstable scaffolding and the stumbling defenders, diving into the End Zone for a 1-point **Touchdown**! It saved them from a shutout, but it was too little, too late for the rebellion! 🏀💥\n\nEven in the final moments, the Wardens kept the intensity high. **Abner Seidel** delivered one last bone-rattling tackle to **Alben Diantha**, sending the hammer-man to the healers. It’s clear the \"heroes\" wanted to send a message tonight: they aren't going down without a fight—and they don't mind getting their fancy armor dirty! ⛓️\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the scoreboard read Oak & Onslaught 4, New Monteforte 1. The series is tied, and we are headed for a Game Three that promises even more carnage! I’m sure **Sir Randy** is patting himself on the back, while **Dame Terra Monteforte** is probably trying to hex the referee! 🏆🤘\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a Yard full of broken glass and even more broken dreams! Stay violent, Osterra! We'll see you for the tie-breaker! 🔥🤘","week":2,"homeScore":1,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-10-2-new-monteforte-oak-and-onslaught","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Ema Ulrick in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana Tackles Symer Crissy and INJURES THEM!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Hole Bowerman and INJURES THEM!","Ema Ulrick tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Mouldon Earl tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but Millham Evangeline blocks it!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but Normi Glaudia blocks it!","Mouldon Earl tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but Affra Yanaton blocks it!","Affra Yanaton shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Milt Casady in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana Tackles Ema Ulrick and INJURES THEM!","Millham Evangeline runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Placido Kora Tackles Millham Evangeline and INJURES THEM!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but Normi Glaudia blocks it!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but Normi Glaudia blocks it!","Boulanger Procto Tackles Normi Glaudia and INJURES THEM!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but Affra Yanaton blocks it!","Boulanger Procto Tackles Teria Ravo and INJURES THEM!","Abner Seidel shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Placido Kora in zone Center Field","Placido Kora tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Abner Seidel Tackles Alben Diantha and INJURES THEM!","Wolbrom Ariella throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Symer Crissy in zone Center Field","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Wynnie Faina, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Center Field","Fogel Raynold runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but misses!","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Affra Yanaton Tackles Raouf Dragone and INJURES THEM!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Alben Diantha passes the ball to Urata Oriana!","Alben Diantha shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Away Field","Gabriele Klehm throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Milt Casady!","Milt Casady shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Away Field","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but Tucker Hett blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Fogel Raynold passes the ball to Boulanger Procto!","Tucker Hett runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Abner Seidel in zone Away Field","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Milt Casady, but Milt Casady blocks it!","Wynnie Faina runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Abner Seidel runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Symer Crissy and INJURES THEM!","Wynnie Faina runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!"],"bracket":"Grand Finals"}
