It’s a glorious Tuesday night for some Trollball action, coming to you live from the shimmering heights of The Glowstone Terrace in the World's Spine Mountains! We’re kicking off the Losers Bracket in these high-stakes playoffs, and the atmosphere is absolutely electric—or maybe that’s just the Glowstone Glare burning my retinas! It's Game 1 of a Best of 3 series, meaning there's no room for error if these teams want to keep their championship dreams from tumbling down the mountainside! 🏔️✨\n\nDown on the field, the home-town Confluence Captains are looking more eccentric than a Guild meeting presided over by that cheese-obsessed Chairman Toland! I just saw Ladew Evelina chug a raw egg, shell and all—now that’s what I call a balanced breakfast for a beating! Meanwhile, Vonni Geoff is slathering his arms in sticky tree sap. It’s messy, it’s gross, and it’s exactly the kind of tactical advantage that makes me tingle in my demonic essence! The Captains have the crowd on their side today, but will the mountain wind blow their luck away? 🌬️🥚\n\nBut don't you dare count out the visitors! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures have arrived, and they look ready to start a riot! Lian Denton is already nursing a dented tin cup of hot gravy, and I can hear Wolbrom Ariella singing a sea shanty so out of tune it might actually be a form of psychological warfare! These Creatures are associated with Dame Terra Monteforte, and you know she didn't raise any quitters—just potential kidnappers! It’s the Guild of the Black Sky versus the White Ravens’ finest brawlers. Grab your snacks and keep your eyes on the ball, because someone is going home in a bucket tonight! 🏟️💀","postGame":"Can you believe it, folks? A real defensive masterpiece and a symphony of shattered ribs! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures have come into the opulent backyard of the Guild and walked away with a 2-0 victory in Game 1! The Glowstone Terrace might be paved with polished rock, but today it was stained with the sweat and tears of the Confluence Captains! It was a playoff atmosphere that would make even Geth the Gravelord crack a smile! 👏🦴\n\nThe action started with a frantic scramble in Center Field, where Belding Chloe snatched up the Trollball like a bargain at the Confluence Market! But the Chaos Creatures weren't here to shop; they were here to maim! Gabriele Klehm laid into Richia Pazit with a tackle so fierce it sent the Captain straight to the healer’s tent! Not to be outdone, Wolbrom Ariella followed up by putting Carnahan Laud on the injury list. It was a beautiful display of carnage that had the rowdy crowd screaming for more! 🔨💥\n\nThen came the play of the game, listeners! Raouf Dragone, that trident-wielding terror, found himself in Home Field with the eyes of a predator. He didn't bother running; he just launched that leather troll head with the precision of a master assassin! It sailed through the goal for a spectacular 2-point shoot! The Chaos Creatures took the lead and never looked back, silencing the Guild sycophants in the stands! 🎯🔥\n\nThe Captains tried to fight back, and boy, did they get mean! O'Conner Maighdlin—who I hear was rhyming his threats all morning—absolutely leveled Fogel Raynold! Belding Chloe showed some fire too, taking out Urata Oriana and later Wolbrom Ariella. It was a back-and-forth of brutality that reminded me of my days in the Demon Prison, only with better lighting and fewer chains! ⛓️👊\n\nWe saw a regular festival of interceptions today! Alben Diantha threw a wild one that Caves Cestar plucked out of the air, only for the Creatures to snatch it back later. It was like watching a group of drunken sailors trying to share a single bottle of rum! Speaking of which, the open bar seems to have hit the Captains hard—Deach Sharlene and Behl Berstine were running around with their boots on the wrong feet! Talk about a lack of coordination! 🍻🥴\n\nAt halftime, the healers worked their magic, stitching up the wounded and tossing them back into the meat grinder. But the break didn't help the Captains' aim! Ladew Evelina and Deach Sharlene both had opportunities to put points on the board from the Away Field, but their shots went wider than Sir Garon Ironrock’s favorite door! You’d think with all that sticky sap on his arms, Vonni Geoff could hold onto the ball, but he dropped it in the 2-point zone like it was a hot coal! 👐💨\n\nBoulanger Procto, who spent his morning arranging his gear in perfect spirals, showed he can arrange an opponent's face just as neatly! He flattened Vonni Geoff early in the second half, ensuring the Captains stayed on their heels. The Chaos Creatures’ defense was a wall of iron and bad intentions, frustrating every attempt the Guild's favorites made to cross the line! 🛡️🚧\n\nAnd what about the 'heroes' of the realm? I didn't see Sir Artorias or that warlock Morgwae coming to save the Captains today! I suppose they're too busy being 'noble' to enjoy a good old-fashioned skull-cracking. Nikos Thanae might be 'Benevolent,' but the only thing benevolent about the Captains today was how easily they gave up possession! Maybe they should spend less time on civic engagement and more time practicing their footwork! 🕊️👎\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the Chaos Creatures held firm. Tucker Hett added one last exclamation point to the game by injuring Richia Pazit again! Talk about adding insult to injury! The Captains look shell-shocked, and the Confluence Market is going to be a very quiet place tonight while the Chaos Creatures celebrate with more hot gravy and off-key singing! 🎶🥣\n\nSo, the series stands at 1-0 in favor of the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures! They’ve taken the lead in this Losers Bracket battle, and the Confluence Captains are officially on the brink of elimination! Can the Guild’s golden boys bounce back, or will the Creatures finish the job in Game 2? Tune in next time, sports fans, for more bone-crunching, heart-stopping Trollball! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the mountains! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🏔️🏆","week":1,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-2-1-confluence-new-monteforte","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Belding Chloe in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Vonni Geoff, but Vonni Geoff blocks it!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but Fogel Raynold blocks it!","Behl Berstine passes the ball to Behl Berstine!","Gabriele Klehm Tackles Richia Pazit and INJURES THEM!","Carnahan Laud shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Raouf Dragone in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Carnahan Laud and INJURES THEM!","Fogel Raynold runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Raouf Dragone shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Center Field","Belding Chloe Tackles Urata Oriana and INJURES THEM!","Alben Diantha passes the ball to Boulanger Procto!","Belding Chloe tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Caves Cestar, but Caves Cestar blocks it!","O'Conner Maighdlin Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Alben Diantha throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Caves Cestar!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Richia Pazit, but misses!","Vonni Geoff tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Belding Chloe runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Richia Pazit passes the ball to Stephan Lisk!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Belding Chloe throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Gabriele Klehm!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Stephan Lisk Tackles Placido Kora and INJURES THEM!","Belding Chloe Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Tucker Hett tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Caves Cestar in zone Away Field","Boulanger Procto Tackles Vonni Geoff and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle O'Conner Maighdlin, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Ladew Evelina shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Raouf Dragone in zone Away Field","Mouldon Earl tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Stephan Lisk tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Raouf Dragone throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Belding Chloe!","Ladew Evelina throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Alben Diantha!","Alben Diantha shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Belding Chloe in zone Away Field","Deach Sharlene shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Away Field","Behl Berstine tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Carnahan Laud!","Belding Chloe runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Tucker Hett Tackles Richia Pazit and INJURES THEM!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Vonni Geoff passes the ball to Vonni Geoff, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Away 2-Point","Urata Oriana tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Ladew Evelina tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but Mouldon Earl blocks it!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
