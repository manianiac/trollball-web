GAME FOUR IS LIVE! ⚾\n\nHello, you beautiful, bloodthirsty bunch! It's your favorite voice of the void, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the most wonderfully dilapidated spot in New Monteforte—**The Unruly Yard**! We are at the absolute edge of history tonight, folks! The Chaos Creatures are sitting on a 2-1 lead in this Best of 5 series. If the rebels win tonight, the crown is theirs! But if the leafy 'heroes' of Oak & Onslaught can find some grit, we're going to a Game Five! 🏟️\n\nI just peeked into the dugouts, and the rituals are in full swing! **Mouldon Earl** of the Chaos Creatures is currently hopping around like a nervous toad, refusing to step on a single line on the field before the whistle! On the other side, **Hole Bowerman** is elbow-deep in the mud, burying her helmet to appease the earth spirits. I hope those spirits like the taste of cheap steel and Warden sweat! And let's not forget **Normi Glaudia**, who is once again sporting his boots on the wrong feet for 'luck.' Tactical brilliance or just a lack of basic literacy? You be the judge! 🩲🌰\n\nThe popularity of these Oak & Onslaught rangers is truly nauseating—the stands are packed with Warden fans wearing those ridiculous feathered caps! But here in the Yard, the graffiti is fresh, the **Unstable Scaffolding** is swaying like a drunken sailor, and the **Rowdy Crowd** is ready to throw more than just insults! With an **Open Bar** tonight, the beer is flowing faster than blood in a butcher shop! Will **Sir Randy** and his fancy-pants rangers defend their reputation, or will the Monteforte rebels turn this linear field into a graveyard? The blood is pumping, and the whistle is ready to scream! Let’s play Trollball! 🔥🏈","postGame":"# 🏆 THE OAK CRASHES DOWN ON MONTEFORTE! WE ARE TIED AT TWO! 🏆\n\nHoly Mackerel, sports fans! What a display of absolute, unmitigated savagery! You’re listening to Nok the Corrupter, and my demonic heart is practically singing after that performance! Oak & Onslaught have roared back with a vengeance, silencing the Unruly Yard with a crushing 6-2 victory! The series is now deadlocked, and we are headed for a winner-take-all Game Five! 🏟️✨\n\nThe game kicked off with **Mouldon Earl** scooping up the troll head, but the Chaos Creatures’ early momentum was as shaky as a rogue's promise. The action really heated up when **Placido Kora** snatched a wild pass from Milt Casady right out of the air! Interception! The crowd went wild, but the 'heroes' weren't about to let the rebels have all the fun in their own backyard! 🏈💥\n\nChaos drew first blood on the scoreboard when **Alben Diantha** found a pocket of space in the Away Field. He launched a prayer of a shot—SWISH—a massive 2-point Shoot! The scoreboard lit up, and for a fleeting moment, it looked like the Monteforte rebellion was going to sweep the series. Sir Randy must have been clutching his fancy bow in terror while the fans doubled down at the open bar! 🎯🍺\n\nBut then, the Oak started to swing back! **Ema Ulrick** found herself in Center Field with a clear line of sight. She didn't hesitate, launching a long-range bomb that sailed through the hoop! That’s 2 points for the Wardens, tying the game and silencing the street performers in the front row! The momentum was shifting faster than a druid’s mood! 🏀✨\n\nLet’s talk about the hits, because golly, they were delicious! **Tucker Hett** decided **Milt Casady** had been upright for too long and delivered a tackle that sounded like a dry branch snapping under a giant's boot! Milt was sent straight to the healers—a bone-crunching highlight that had the crowd roaring for more medical bills! 🚑🦴\n\nOak & Onslaught took the lead when **Normi Glaudia**, despite having his boots on the wrong feet, found his range! He launched another 2-point Shoot from Center Field, making it 4-2! I suppose when you’re a 'hero,' the universe rewards your fashion disasters with points. The Wardens were starting to look as immovable as an old oak tree! 🎯🤘\n\nAs we hit halftime, the players were looking a bit wobbly. With the **Open Bar** in full effect, **Wolbrom Ariella** was seen swaying almost as much as the unstable scaffolding! Healer **Ahron Latashia** was busier than a one-armed wallpaper hanger, stitching the rangers back together while **Lian Denton** chugged enough gravy to fill a moat! 🏥🥓\n\nThe second half was a literal parade of stretchers! **Hole Bowerman** decided to take revenge for her captain, leveling **Mouldon Earl** with a lance tackle that likely rattled the very foundations of the city! Mouldon was hauled off to the infirmary, proving that the earth spirits really do favor those who bury their gear in the dirt! 🚑🔨\n\nThe Chaos Creatures tried to rally, but **Gabriele Klehm** decided to pick a fight with **Wynnie Faina**, sending the mace-wielder to the injury list with a crunch that echoed off the graffiti-covered walls! It was a masterpiece of attrition, and my demonic heart was pining for even more fractures! ⛓️🏥\n\nThe nail in the coffin came from **Millham Evangeline**. After navigating a sea of tackles and stumbling defenders, Millham launched one final 2-point bomb from the Home Field! Final score: Oak & Onslaught 6, New Monteforte 2! The 'heroes' have forced a Game Five, and the series is tied 2-2! 🏀🏆\n\nChaos had their moments, but the Wardens showed that popularity and fancy weapons actually count for something when the pressure is on. **Abner Seidel** was sent to the healers late by a vicious **Wolbrom Ariella** hit, and **Teria Ravo** followed him shortly after thanks to **Fogel Raynold**, but the points were already in the bag! 🏥💥\n\nSo here we are, Osterra! One game remains to decide the absolute champion of the realm! Will the Wardens keep their crown, or will the Chaos Creatures burn the whole forest down in the finale? I’m betting on the blood! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a stadium full of drunk fans and very busy surgeons! Stay violent, sports fans! 🤘🔥","week":4,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":6,"slug":"po-10-4-new-monteforte-oak-and-onslaught","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but misses!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but Urata Oriana blocks it!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Millham Evangeline tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Urata Oriana shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Abner Seidel in zone Center Field","Milt Casady throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Placido Kora!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella passes the ball to Mouldon Earl, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Center Field","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but Urata Oriana blocks it!","Boulanger Procto passes the ball to Fogel Raynold!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but Alben Diantha blocks it!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but Abner Seidel blocks it!","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but Wolbrom Ariella blocks it!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but misses!","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Alben Diantha runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Alben Diantha shoots from Away Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Millham Evangeline!","Ema Ulrick shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Wynnie Faina in zone Center Field","Tucker Hett Tackles Milt Casady and INJURES THEM!","Normi Glaudia shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Raouf Dragone in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but Millham Evangeline blocks it!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Wynnie Faina in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Hole Bowerman in zone Center Field","Affra Yanaton runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Hole Bowerman Tackles Mouldon Earl and INJURES THEM!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Teria Ravo, but Teria Ravo blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm Tackles Wynnie Faina and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but misses!","Hole Bowerman tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Millham Evangeline passes the ball to Symer Crissy!","Millham Evangeline shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Teria Ravo in zone Center Field","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but misses!","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Hole Bowerman, but misses!","Affra Yanaton passes the ball to Hole Bowerman!","Wynnie Faina runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Millham Evangeline tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Abner Seidel and INJURES THEM!","Fogel Raynold Tackles Teria Ravo and INJURES THEM!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Wynnie Faina, but Wynnie Faina blocks it!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but Ema Ulrick blocks it!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Hole Bowerman, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but misses!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but Symer Crissy blocks it!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but misses!"],"bracket":"Grand Finals"}
