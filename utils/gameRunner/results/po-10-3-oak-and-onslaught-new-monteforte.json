GAME THREE IS ON THE AIR! ⚾\n\nWell, hello there, you beautiful, bloodthirsty bunch! Nok the Corrupter here, coming to you live from the booth at Fletchings Field! We are in the thick of it now, folks! The Grand Finals series is tied up at one win apiece, and this Game Three is the swing vote that could tip the scales toward destiny! The druids are currently out on the field whispering to the roots, and let me tell you, that Shifting Terrain is already looking like a maze designed by a drunken minotaur! 🌳\n\nI just took a gander at the Oak & Onslaught dugout, and those 'heroes' are up to their usual shenanigans! Milt Casady is leading a synchronized chant that’s currently louder than a banshee in a library, while Wynnie Faina and Normi Glaudia are diligently putting their boots on the wrong feet! Tactical brilliance or just plain silly? You be the judge! Meanwhile, Hole Bowerman is knee-deep in a hole, burying her helmet to appease the dirt spirits. I hope the spirits like the taste of cheap steel! 🌰\n\nBut look at those rebels from New Monteforte! The Chaos Creatures aren't here for a picnic! Lian Denton is currently chugging a tin cup of steaming hot gravy—that’s the kind of high-octane fuel that turns a healer into a herald of havoc! And Boulanger Procto is meticulously arranging his gear in a perfect, aesthetically pleasing spiral. It’s almost a shame it’s about to be covered in Warden blood and mud! 🌀\n\nThe Open Bar is officially flowing, and the Warden fans are already swaying like the trees! Will Sir Randy and his fancy-pants rangers defend their home turf, or will the Chaos Creatures turn this botanical garden into a graveyard? My demonic heart is pitter-pattering for the carnage! Let’s play Trollball! 🔥🏈","postGame":"# 🏆 A CARNAGE CATHEDRAL AT FLETCHINGS FIELD! 🏆\n\nHoly Mackerel, sports fans! You are listening to the sweet, gravelly voice of Nok the Corrupter, and my demonic heart is practically singing after that display of sheer, unadulterated violence! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures didn't just win; they delivered a masterclass in destruction, crushing the Warden favorites Oak & Onslaught with a staggering score of 9 to 2! The series lead is now 2-1 for the rebels, and the 'heroes' are looking more like garden trimmings! 🏟️✨\n\nThe match kicked off with Alben Diantha snatching the troll head, and the Chaos Creatures immediately showed they weren't interested in a polite game of catch. Fogel Raynold, looking like a man possessed, broke through the defensive line and DUNKS the ball into the goal! A beautiful 1-point start that silenced the feathered caps in the front row faster than a warlock with a sore throat! 🏀\n\nBut the Monteforte squad was just getting warmed up! Wolbrom Ariella—fresh from singing a sea shanty that was mercifully drowned out by the crowd—stepped up to Center Field and launched a prayer! SWISH! A massive 2-point Shoot that put the Creatures up by 3 before the Wardens could even fix their boots! It was a sniper's delight that left the druids scratching their heads! 🎯😱\n\nOak & Onslaught tried to fire back with some of that 'heroic' grit. Wynnie Faina, clearly tired of the Chaos momentum, delivered a bone-rattling tackle to Fogel Raynold, sending the Monteforte star straight to the injury list! You could hear the crunch from the VIP box! My goodness, the medical staff is earning their gold tonight! 🚑💥\n\nJust when it looked like the Wardens might mount a comeback, Normi Glaudia managed a clutch interception, allowing Millham Evangeline to find some space. Millham launched a long-range bomb from Center Field—BOOM! A 2-point Shoot for the home team! It brought the score to 3-2 and for a fleeting moment, the 'heroes' thought they had a chance! 🏀✨\n\nThen came halftime, and let me tell you, the Open Bar was the real MVP for the fans. Half the spectators are so pickled they think they're at a wedding! But the Chaos Creatures used the break to sharpen their blades. While Ahron Latashia was busy stitching Warden limbs back on, the Monteforte rebels were drinking more gravy and preparing for a literal slaughter! 🍺🏥\n\nThe second half was a symphony of stretchers! Affra Yanaton tried to set the tone by leveling Wolbrom Ariella, but the Chaos Creatures weren't intimidated. Fogel Raynold returned from the healers with a vengeance, immediately flattening Ema Ulrick! The back-and-forth brutality was so beautiful it almost brought a tear to my eye! 🦴\n\nThe score then exploded! Gabriele Klehm, who spent the pre-game kissing the trollball's nose, launched a 2-pointer that sailed true! Not to be outdone, Tucker Hett decided to turn the game into a shooting gallery, launching two consecutive 2-point Shoots—one from Center Field and a final, back-breaking bomb from the Home Field! The scoreboard was spinning faster than a dizzy goblin! 🎯🤘\n\nThe hits just kept coming like a landslide! Milt Casady took out Placido Kora, but the Wardens were losing the war of attrition. Raouf Dragone, the trident-wielding poet, decided Symer Crissy had been on the field too long and sent her to the healers! Affra Yanaton managed to return the favor by leveling Raouf, but the damage was already done! 🏥🔨\n\nBy the final whistle, Fletchings Field looked more like a hospital ward than a sports arena. The Chaos Creatures stood tall in the mud, celebrating a 9-2 blowout that has left the Warden economy—and Falric’s pride—in absolute shambles! If this is what 'heroism' looks like, I’ll take the rebels any day of the week! 🏆\n\nThe series stands at 2-1 for New Monteforte! One more win and they’ll have the crown and the bragging rights to last an eternity! Will Sir Randy polish his fancy bow and find a miracle, or will the Chaos burn it all down in Game Four? I'm betting on the fire! 🔥\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a stadium full of drunk fans and very busy healers! Stay violent, Osterra! See you for the next one! 🤘🔥","week":3,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":9,"slug":"po-10-3-oak-and-onslaught-new-monteforte","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Alben Diantha in zone Center Field","Mouldon Earl runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Mouldon Earl tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Urata Oriana runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Fogel Raynold passes to Fogel Raynold in the End Zone, who dunks the ball into the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Wynnie Faina Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but Placido Kora blocks it!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but Tucker Hett blocks it!","Fogel Raynold throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Normi Glaudia!","Millham Evangeline shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Normi Glaudia in zone Center Field","Milt Casady passes the ball to Normi Glaudia!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Affra Yanaton shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Placido Kora in zone Center Field","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but misses!","Ema Ulrick tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Affra Yanaton in zone Center Field","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Center Field","Affra Yanaton Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but misses!","Fogel Raynold Tackles Ema Ulrick and INJURES THEM!","Milt Casady Tackles Placido Kora and INJURES THEM!","Normi Glaudia Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone passes the ball to Boulanger Procto!","Ema Ulrick tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Ema Ulrick, but misses!","Ema Ulrick Tackles Fogel Raynold and INJURES THEM!","Tucker Hett shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Center Field","Alben Diantha tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Mouldon Earl runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Raouf Dragone Tackles Symer Crissy and INJURES THEM!","Affra Yanaton Tackles Raouf Dragone and INJURES THEM!","Tucker Hett shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Boulanger Procto throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Normi Glaudia!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Milt Casady runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!"],"bracket":"Grand Finals"}
