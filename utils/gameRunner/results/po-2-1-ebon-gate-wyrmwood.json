This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the sludge-filled glory of the Sinking Field! Pull up a chair and pour yourself a glass of something that'll melt your teeth, because it's playoff time in the Losers Bracket! We are kicking off Game 1 of a Best of 3 series, and the air is thick—partly with tension, and mostly with the noxious fumes rising from the unstable turf! It's a real treat for the senses, I tell you! 🏟️💀\n\nThe home crowd is... well, they're here! Maybe not in droves, but what they lack in numbers, they make up for in sheer, unadulterated gloom! My favorite bunch of miscreants, the Ebon Gate Corruptors, are looking to send those Wyrmwood Stronghammers back to the tower in pieces! The Stronghammers are looking focused, though I suspect Ultun Barthelemy is more focused on braiding his teammate's nose hair than the ball! Truly, the pre-game rituals in this league are a testament to the mental fortitude—or lack thereof—of our players! 👃🪮\n\nSpeaking of rituals, I caught Kerwin Gasper asking the referee to bless their Kriegsmesser! Can you believe it? In this economy? Meanwhile, our boys from the Ebon Gate were busy daring each other to eat live worms. That’s the kind of grit—and protein—that wins championships! Keep an eye on the ground today, folks; if the thick mud doesn't swallow you, the sinkholes surely will! Let’s get ready for some Trollball! 🪱💥","postGame":"# 🏟️ POST-GAME WRAP-UP: A MUDDY HEARTBREAKER! 🏟️\n\nHoly smokes, what a way to start the series! The Sinking Field certainly lived up to its name today, swallowing cleats and dignity alike! It was a bone-rattling, mud-caked affair that saw the Wyrmwood Stronghammers sneak away with a 3-2 victory in this opening playoff tilt! The atmosphere was as heavy as Sir Tanos' conscience after a night of stabbing people who can't read! 🏟️🌪️\n\nThe action started fast and furious! Godart Urissa, wearing that ridiculously oversized floppy hat, scooped up the troll head in center field like a hungry wolf! Before the Corruptors could even wipe the noxious fumes from their eyes, Kerwin Gasper stepped up and absolutely nailed a long-distance shot! Two points on the board before the mud could even settle! Talk about a start! 🎯🔥\n\nOur Corruptors tried to fight back, but the tackling was a bit shaky early on! Amedeo Bari and Smith Syst were swinging at shadows! Meanwhile, Autumn Jodoin was chugging raw eggs and running like a possessed stag, charging straight into the end zone for a dunk! That put the Stronghammers up by three, and I tell you, my dark heart was sinking faster than a spectator in the West Stand! 🥚💨\n\nBut then came the violence! Oh, the beautiful, crunchy violence! Olnek Vizzone finally found his footing and absolutely leveled Sabian Gleason! The sound of that impact was better than any sea shanty Judi Carrington could ever sing! Sabian went down hard, and the medical staff had to wade through the thick mud to drag him off! 👊🩸\n\nAhasuerus An was a one-woman wrecking crew for the Corruptors! She tackled Sondra Elaina and Ultun Barthelemy into next Tuesday! It was a display of defensive prowess that would make even Morgwae blush, though he’s too busy being 'exiled' to appreciate real talent! The field was practically littered with Stronghammers by the time the halftime whistle blew! ⚔️🦴\n\nHalftime saw everyone patched up by the healers, including Hamburger Marthe, who I assume stopped sticking beans in his nose long enough to work some magic. When the second half started, the Corruptors came out swinging! Judi Carrington sent Calvinna Isador to the dirt with a tackle that surely rattled her ancestors! 🏥🩺\n\nThe comeback was on! Amedeo Bari found an opening and dunked that troll head with the grace of a falling anvil! The Sinking Field erupted—or maybe that was just a gas pocket bursting! Either way, it was 3-1! The momentum was shifting, and you could feel the desperation in the Wyrmwood ranks! 🏀👹\n\nSimsar Carrelli kept the fire burning! After some fancy passing play, he charged through the mud and slammed another dunk home! 3-2! It was a one-point game, and I was screaming loud enough to wake Lord Orzalon from his prison nap! The Corruptors were clawing their way back, showing that 'never-say-die' attitude that makes them the best in the realm! 📈🙌\n\nThe final minutes were pure chaos! Odelia Abbott and Simsar Carrelli were trading blows, with Ellette Paz and Cornela Piscatelli both being carted off the field with fresh injuries! The mud was getting deeper, the fumes were getting thicker, and Napoleon Anzovin was looking to make a hero play! 🌪️🤕\n\nBut alas, tragedy struck! Napoleon tried a wild pass, probably thinking he was as smooth as Falric the heart-thief, but it was intercepted by that hat-wearing Godart Urissa! That sealed the deal, folks. The Wyrmwood Stronghammers take Game 1 of this Best of 3 series. My Corruptors have their backs against the wall, but don't count them out yet! We’ll be back for Game 2, hopefully with less mud in our ears! 🏟️💀","week":1,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":3,"slug":"po-2-1-ebon-gate-wyrmwood","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Godart Urissa in zone Center Field","Amedeo Bari tries to Tackle Calvinna Isador, but misses!","Smith Syst tries to Tackle Sabian Gleason, but misses!","Olnek Vizzone tries to Tackle Kerwin Gasper, but misses!","Bullion Iglesias tries to Tackle Sabian Gleason, but misses!","Ultun Barthelemy tries to Tackle Amedeo Bari, but misses!","Kerwin Gasper shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Calvinna Isador in zone Center Field","Olnek Vizzone Tackles Sabian Gleason and INJURES THEM!","Autumn Jodoin runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Odelia Abbott runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Autumn Jodoin runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Ellette Paz in zone Center Field","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Smith Syst, but misses!","Bullion Iglesias tries to Tackle Godart Urissa, but Godart Urissa blocks it!","Kerwin Gasper tries to Tackle Judi Carrington, but misses!","Amedeo Bari runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Ahasuerus An Tackles Sondra Elaina and INJURES THEM!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Ellette Paz, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Ahasuerus An, but Ahasuerus An blocks it!","Ellette Paz shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Napoleon Anzovin in zone Away Field","Autumn Jodoin Tackles Olnek Vizzone and INJURES THEM!","Ahasuerus An Tackles Ultun Barthelemy and INJURES THEM!","Bullion Iglesias runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Ahasuerus An shoots from Away 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Rebane Kendy in zone Away 2-Point","Amedeo Bari tries to Tackle Autumn Jodoin, but Autumn Jodoin blocks it!","Ahasuerus An tries to Tackle Calvinna Isador, but misses!","Smith Syst tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but Rebane Kendy blocks it!","Bullion Iglesias Tackles Autumn Jodoin and INJURES THEM!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by As Utter in zone Away 2-Point","Kerwin Gasper tries to Tackle As Utter, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle As Utter, but misses!","Judi Carrington Tackles Calvinna Isador and INJURES THEM!","Amedeo Bari runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Judi Carrington in zone Center Field","Olnek Vizzone tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Napoleon Anzovin passes the ball to As Utter!","Amedeo Bari tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Bullion Iglesias runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Ellette Paz tries to Tackle Odelia Abbott, but Odelia Abbott blocks it!","Napoleon Anzovin passes the ball to Ahasuerus An, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Amedeo Bari in zone Away Field","Bullion Iglesias runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Simsar Carrelli runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Kerwin Gasper in zone Center Field","Napoleon Anzovin tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Olnek Vizzone tries to Tackle Godart Urissa, but misses!","As Utter tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Godart Urissa runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Cornela Piscatelli runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Napoleon Anzovin tries to Tackle Godart Urissa, but misses!","Bullion Iglesias tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Kerwin Gasper passes the ball to Rebane Kendy, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Judi Carrington in zone Home 2-Point","Ellette Paz tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Odelia Abbott Tackles Ellette Paz and INJURES THEM!","Simsar Carrelli Tackles Cornela Piscatelli and INJURES THEM!","Napoleon Anzovin throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Godart Urissa!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
