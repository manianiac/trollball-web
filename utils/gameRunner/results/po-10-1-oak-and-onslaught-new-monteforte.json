start of the ULTIMATE series! We have reset the bracket, folks, and now it is a Best of Five to decide who wears the crown forever! We are at Fletchings Field, where the druids are currently whispering to the grass and making the end zones move like a dizzy goblin! The energy is higher than a warlock on soul-dust! I see the hometown favorites, Oak & Onslaught, looking quite dapper... though Wynnie Faina and Normi Glaudia appear to have their boots on the wrong feet again! Ha! What tactical brilliance! 🌳 \n\nMeanwhile, the Chaos Creatures are in the dugout. Lian Denton is currently chugging a tin cup of steaming hot gravy! That's how you build a champion's constitution! Boulanger Procto is meticulously arranging his gear in a perfect spiral—I'm sure he's hoping the druids don't spiral the field right out from under him! Grab your mugs, fans, because with an open bar and shifting terrain, this is going to be a glorious wreck! 🍺 \n\nWill Sir Randy and his fancy-pants rangers find a way to navigate their own shifting field, or will the Monteforte rebels turn this botanical garden into a graveyard? The blood is pumping, and the whistle is ready to scream! Let’s play Trollball! 🔥🏈","postGame":"# 🏆 THE CHAOS CLAW THEIR WAY TO THE TOP! 🏆 \n\nHoly Mackerel, sports fans! What a way to start the Grand Finals series! You are listening to the sweet, gravelly voice of Nok the Corrupter, and my demonic heart is absolutely singing after that display of sheer, unadulterated violence! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures have drawn first blood in this Best of Five, defeating the Warden favorites Oak & Onslaught with a score of 2 to 1! 🏟️✨ \n\nThe match kicked off with Affra Yanaton scooping up the troll head in Center Field, but the Chaos Creatures weren't about to let the \"heroes\" have an easy path. Symer Crissy made a valiant run, but the real fireworks started when Millham Evangeline decided to introduce Gabriele Klehm's face to the dirt! Gabriele was sent straight to the healers—a beautiful, bone-crunching start that set the tone for the evening! 🚑 \n\nBut don't you worry, the rebels from New Monteforte had plenty of fight in them! Placido Kora, looking like a woman possessed, delivered a tackle to Teria Ravo that likely rattled the very foundations of Fletchings Field! Teria was hauled off, much to the chagrin of the Warden fans who were already five mugs deep into the open bar! The stadium's Shifting Terrain started to show its teeth as players stumbled over roots that weren't there a second ago! 🌳 \n\nThe carnage continued as Wolbrom Ariella leveled Millham Evangeline! I tell you, folks, the medical staff tonight is working harder than a demon in a soul-factory! Millham went down hard, and the Chaos Creatures showed that popularity doesn't mean a thing when a scythe is swinging at your shins! 🏥 \n\nDespite the pressure, the Wardens found a sliver of that \"heroic\" luck. Ema Ulrick managed to break through the defensive line and DUNKS the ball into the goal! A 1-point touchdown for the home team! Sir Randy must have been polishing his fancy bow in pride, but the Monteforte crowd was more interested in the street performers and the unstable scaffolding that nearly crushed a group of rangers! 🏀💥 \n\nHalftime hit, and let me tell you, the open bar was the real MVP. Half the fans are so pickled they think they're watching a game of catch with a regular ball! But the players were fueled by something stronger. Ahron Latashia and Lian Denton were busy stitching limbs back on as the teams prepared for a second half of absolute mayhem! 🍺 \n\nThe second half was a symphony of destruction! Urata Oriana, fresh from his pre-game weapon-testing, decided Milt Casady didn't need to be upright anymore! Milt was sent to the sidelines, followed quickly by Ema Ulrick, who was leveled by Mouldon Earl! The Chaos Creatures were playing like they had a personal vendetta against anyone with a badge! ⛓️ \n\nMouldon Earl wasn't done, though! He went back for seconds and took out Millham Evangeline again! The consistency of the violence was truly inspiring! Even Symer Crissy got in on the action for the Wardens, injuring Placido Kora, but it was too little, too late for the favorites. The field was looking more like a hospital ward than a sports arena! 🏥🔨 \n\nThen came the play of the game! Urata Oriana, looking as cool as a frozen bog, found himself in Center Field with a clear line. He didn't run—he launched a prayer! The troll head sailed through the air, past the reaching hands of the defenders, and SWISH! A 2-point Shoot that turned the game on its head! The Chaos Creatures surged into the lead 2-1! 🎯😱 \n\nOak & Onslaught tried to rally, with Wynnie Faina taking a long shot that sailed wide, likely because his boots were still on the wrong feet! Fogel Raynold snatched the rebound and the defense held firm. Tucker Hett even took a final shot that missed, but the clock was the real enemy of the heroes tonight! 🚮 \n\nWhen the final whistle blew, the Chaos Creatures stood tall in the mud! Final score: New Monteforte 2, Oak & Onslaught 1! The Wardens might have the flashy bows and the fancy titles, but the rebels have the first win of the series! Falric and Levania better find a way to fix this, or the Chaos is going to walk away with the whole crown! 🏆🤘 \n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a stadium full of drunk fans and broken bones! Stay violent, Osterra! See you for Game Two! 🔥🤘","week":1,"homeScore":1,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-10-1-oak-and-onslaught-new-monteforte","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Affra Yanaton in zone Center Field","Symer Crissy runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Millham Evangeline tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Millham Evangeline Tackles Gabriele Klehm and INJURES THEM!","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Teria Ravo, but misses!","Placido Kora Tackles Teria Ravo and INJURES THEM!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Wynnie Faina, but Wynnie Faina blocks it!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Milt Casady, but Milt Casady blocks it!","Affra Yanaton tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Wynnie Faina tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Wolbrom Ariella Tackles Millham Evangeline and INJURES THEM!","Symer Crissy runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Hole Bowerman shoots from Away 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Away 2-Point","Urata Oriana tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Mouldon Earl passes the ball to Fogel Raynold!","Gabriele Klehm passes the ball to Urata Oriana!","Tucker Hett tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Urata Oriana passes the ball to Alben Diantha, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Raouf Dragone in zone Away 2-Point","Boulanger Procto shoots from Away 2-Point but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Away 2-Point","Placido Kora throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Symer Crissy in zone Away 2-Point","Placido Kora Tackles Wynnie Faina and INJURES THEM!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Affra Yanaton, but misses!","Ema Ulrick runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Placido Kora in zone Center Field","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Milt Casady in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana Tackles Milt Casady and INJURES THEM!","Mouldon Earl Tackles Ema Ulrick and INJURES THEM!","Mouldon Earl Tackles Millham Evangeline and INJURES THEM!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but misses!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Hole Bowerman, but Hole Bowerman blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Normi Glaudia, but Normi Glaudia blocks it!","Symer Crissy Tackles Placido Kora and INJURES THEM!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but misses!","Tucker Hett tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but misses!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle Wynnie Faina, but Wynnie Faina blocks it!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Teria Ravo, but misses!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Hole Bowerman, but Hole Bowerman blocks it!","Fogel Raynold Tackles Normi Glaudia and INJURES THEM!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Symer Crissy, but Symer Crissy blocks it!","Wynnie Faina shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Fogel Raynold in zone Center Field","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Abner Seidel, but misses!","Urata Oriana shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana passes the ball to Tucker Hett, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Fogel Raynold in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but Wolbrom Ariella blocks it!","Tucker Hett shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but Wolbrom Ariella blocks it!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!"],"bracket":"Grand Finals"}
