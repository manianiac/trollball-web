Step right up and grab a cold one, because we are live at the Guilder's Field for a real humdinger in the Losers Bracket! It is Game One of this Best-of-Three series between the Desert Spectres and the New Prosperity Profits! The atmosphere is thicker than the smog over a goblin forge, and the stakes couldn't be higher! The loser of this series gets sent packing, while the winner keeps their dreams of glory alive in this brutal playoff gauntlet! I can see Eileen Mikihisa on the sidelines right now, trying to teach a stray mutt how to balance a coin on its nose—absolute nonsense, but you have to admire the focus! Meanwhile, Steve is already organizing a betting pool; I have got twenty gold on the first broken rib! Over in the Profits' dugout, Yoshi Cathy is devouring a raw onion layer by layer, and I haven't seen a single tear! That is the kind of grit that makes a demon’s heart skip a beat! The Merchant's Guild has their fancy velvet boxes all polished up for the bankers, but they better watch out for the Market Fluctuation because things are about to get volatile! The Spectres might not have the biggest fan club in the stands today, but with Geth the Gravelord as their patron, they play like they have already died once or twice! It is a beautiful day for a disaster, so let us get to the action!","postGame":"Holy smokes, what a display of organized mayhem we witnessed today! The Desert Spectres came out swinging—and stabbing—to take a commanding lead in this series! The action started fast when Eileen Mikihisa sent a shot screaming through the air from Center Field, putting the Spectres on the board before the bankers could even finish their first martinis! It was a real peach of a play that set the tone for the entire afternoon! Not to be outdone, Heyes Iver decided he did not even need to get close, launching a spectacular shot from the Home Field that found the bottom of the basket! That is a four-point lead for the Spectres that had the Hired Hecklers shutting their traps for a change! But Trollball is not just about the score, it is about the scars, and boy, did we see some doozies! Bahr Ethelstan absolutely leveled Krueger Jacinthe, sending him to the infirmary early with a hit that rattled the floorboards! It was enough to make even the celebrity hero Sir Artorias the Moonslayer blush, if that fellow ever stopped looking in a mirror long enough to notice the game! The Profits tried to mount a comeback, with Gladdie Farika showing some real fire by putting Angelita Darce on the ground in a heap of armor! Boleslaw Heathcote finally gave the home crowd something to cheer about, driving into the End Zone for a thunderous dunk that actually registered on the scorekeeper's ledger! But the momentum swung right back to the Spectres when Huesman Ring decided Milman Galvan did not need to be standing anymore, delivering a tackle that was as legal as it was lethal! After the halftime bells rang and the healers did their spooky work to patch up the wounded, the second half became a defensive slugfest of the highest order! Boleslaw Heathcote gave Steve a one-way ticket to the dirt, showing that the Profits were not going down without a fight despite the mounting deficit! There was a lot of frantic scrambling in the Center Field, with Yoshi Cathy and Pulchi Benyamin trying to find a gap in the sandstone-tough defense of the Spectres! Milman Galvan got some revenge by taking Heyes Iver out of the play, but the Spectres' wall just would not crumble under the pressure of the hostile takeover! Lovash Marius delivered the final exclamation point of the evening, sending Krueger Jacinthe back to the dirt just as he was getting his bearings! When the final whistle blew, the scoreboard read four to one in favor of the Spectres, leaving the home crowd in a stunned silence! Chairman Brennen Farno is going to have a hard time explaining this loss to the Guild back home, especially after all that talk about prosperity! The Spectres take a one-zero lead in the series, and if the Profits do not find some spine soon, they will be packing their bags for the long walk back through the wastes! What a glorious afternoon of carnage and competition, exactly how the Ebon Gate Corruptors like to see it played! Tune in next time to see if the Spectres can sweep or if the Profits can find a way to balance their books!","week":1,"homeScore":1,"awayScore":4,"slug":"po-2-1-new-prosperity-desert","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Angelita Darce in zone Center Field","Eileen Mikihisa shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Muscolo Jaehne in zone Center Field","Bahr Ethelstan tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Muscolo Jaehne runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Boleslaw Heathcote tries to Tackle Bahr Ethelstan, but misses!","Steve tries to Tackle Pellikka Concettina, but misses!","Heyes Iver shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Faina Hendrix in zone Center Field","Gladdie Farika tries to Tackle Muscolo Jaehne, but misses!","Fidellia Mozelle tries to Tackle Pellikka Concettina, but misses!","Faina Hendrix runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bahr Ethelstan Tackles Krueger Jacinthe and INJURES THEM!","Bahr Ethelstan tries to Tackle Pellikka Concettina, but Pellikka Concettina blocks it!","Muscolo Jaehne tries to Tackle Milman Galvan, but misses!","Gladdie Farika runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Bahr Ethelstan tries to Tackle Aufmann Tedric, but Aufmann Tedric blocks it!","Faina Hendrix tries to Tackle Bahr Ethelstan, but misses!","Yoshi Cathy passes the ball to Pellikka Concettina, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Boleslaw Heathcote in zone Away 2-Point","Angelita Darce tries to Tackle Boleslaw Heathcote, but misses!","Eileen Mikihisa Tackles Pulchi Benyamin and INJURES THEM!","Shelman McQuoid tries to Tackle Gladdie Farika, but Gladdie Farika blocks it!","Huesman Ring Tackles Milman Galvan and INJURES THEM!","Heyes Iver tries to Tackle Yoshi Cathy, but misses!","Yoshi Cathy tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Eileen Mikihisa tries to Tackle Abramson Doxia, but misses!","Gladdie Farika Tackles Angelita Darce and INJURES THEM!","Boleslaw Heathcote runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Shelman McQuoid in zone Center Field","Gladdie Farika tries to Tackle Muscolo Jaehne, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Faina Hendrix in zone Center Field","Aufmann Tedric passes the ball to Yoshi Cathy, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Lovash Marius in zone Center Field","Yoshi Cathy tries to Tackle Lovash Marius, but Lovash Marius blocks it!","Boleslaw Heathcote Tackles Steve and INJURES THEM!","Huesman Ring tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Shelman McQuoid tries to Tackle Pellikka Concettina, but Pellikka Concettina blocks it!","Bahr Ethelstan shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Pellikka Concettina in zone Center Field","Gladdie Farika passes the ball to Yoshi Cathy!","Muscolo Jaehne tries to Tackle Boleslaw Heathcote, but misses!","Heyes Iver tries to Tackle Gladdie Farika, but misses!","Pulchi Benyamin tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Milman Galvan Tackles Heyes Iver and INJURES THEM!","Gladdie Farika tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Lovash Marius tries to Tackle Pulchi Benyamin, but Pulchi Benyamin blocks it!","Pulchi Benyamin tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Shelman McQuoid tries to Tackle Gladdie Farika, but misses!","Huesman Ring tries to Tackle Milman Galvan, but Milman Galvan blocks it!","Muscolo Jaehne tries to Tackle Pulchi Benyamin, but Pulchi Benyamin blocks it!","Fidellia Mozelle tries to Tackle Milman Galvan, but Milman Galvan blocks it!","Gladdie Farika runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Lovash Marius tries to Tackle Pellikka Concettina, but misses!","Lovash Marius Tackles Krueger Jacinthe and INJURES THEM!","Fidellia Mozelle tries to Tackle Abramson Doxia, but misses!","Eileen Mikihisa tries to Tackle Milman Galvan, but misses!","Yoshi Cathy tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Muscolo Jaehne tries to Tackle Yoshi Cathy, but Yoshi Cathy blocks it!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
