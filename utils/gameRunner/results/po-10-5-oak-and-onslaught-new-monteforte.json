THE FINAL CURTAIN RISES! ⚾  Hello, you beautiful, bloodthirsty bunch! Nok the Corrupter here, your favorite voice from the void, bringing you the series-deciding finale of the Tuesday Night Trollball Grand Finals! We are live at **Fletchings Field**, and the air is thicker than a troll's skull! The series is deadlocked at 2-2! After a grueling Best of 5, it all comes down to this one match! The druids have been busy whispering to the bushes, and the **Shifting Terrain** is already making the end zones look like they're trying to escape! 🌳  I just peeked into the dugouts, and the rituals are in full swing! **Wynnie Faina** and **Normi Glaudia** of Oak & Onslaught are out there with their boots on the wrong feet—tactical brilliance or a literacy issue? You be the judge! Meanwhile, **Hole Bowerman** is elbow-deep in the dirt, burying her helmet like a metal squirrel! I suppose if you want a sturdy head, you have to let it commune with the roots first! 🌰  But look at those rebels from New Monteforte! The Chaos Creatures aren't here for a picnic! **Lian Denton** just downed a shot of steaming hot gravy from a dented tin cup—now that’s a champion’s fuel! **Boulanger Procto** is meticulously arranging his gear in a perfect spiral. It’s almost a shame it’s about to be covered in Warden blood! 🌀  The **Open Bar** is officially flowing, and the fans are already swaying like the trees! These Oak & Onslaught 'heroes' might be the local darlings, but in the Yard of my heart, I’m betting on the blood! Will **Sir Randy** keep his trophy, or will the rebels burn it all down? Let’s play Trollball! 🔥🏈","postGame":"# 🏆 THE OAK STANDS FIRM! OAK & ONSLAUGHT ARE THE CHAMPIONS! 🏆  Holy Mackerel, sports fans! You are listening to the sweet, gravelly voice of Nok the Corrupter, and my demonic heart is practically singing after that display of sheer, unadulterated violence! In a match that defined the word 'carnage,' **Oak & Onslaught** have claimed the title with a 4-2 victory over the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures! The series ends 3-2, and the 'heroes' of the realm have their crown! 🏟️✨  The match kicked off with a frantic scramble as **Placido Kora** snatched the troll head, but the Chaos Creatures' early momentum was as shaky as a rogue's promise! **Wolbrom Ariella** and **Urata Oriana** couldn't keep a handle on the ball, dropping it like it was a hot coal from a hellfire forge! It was a comedy of errors that had the rowdy crowd screaming for more gravy! 🏈  The first real boom came when **Teria Ravo** decided **Tucker Hett** didn't need to be upright anymore! Teria delivered a tackle that sounded like a dry branch snapping under a giant's boot! Tucker was hauled off to the healers—a beautiful, bone-crunching highlight that set the tone for the Warden's defense! 🚑💥  Oak & Onslaught finally drew blood on the scoreboard when **Abner Seidel**, likely fueled by those garish undergarments of his, found his range from Center Field! He launched a prayer that sailed through the hoop for a massive **2-point Shoot**! Sir Randy must be polishing his fancy bow in pride while the Monteforte rebels started looking like they’d just been told they had to pay taxes! 🎯  The second half saw some incredible interceptions! **Symer Crissy** threw a pass that **Wolbrom Ariella** snatched right out of the air, but the Chaos Creatures couldn't capitalize. Then, **Fogel Raynold** tried a wild one that **Teria Ravo** intercepted right back! It was a regular game of 'keep away' with the added bonus of potential skull fractures! 🏀✨  The Wardens put the nail in the coffin just before the break! **Ema Ulrick** found herself in the Home 2-Point zone and didn't hesitate. She launched another long-range bomb—SWISH—putting the Oak up 4-0! The 'heroes' were putting on a clinic, leaving the Creatures in the dirt and the fans doubling down at the open bar! 😱  Halftime hit, and let me tell you, the medical staff was busier than a one-armed wallpaper hanger! **Ahron Latashia** and **Lian Denton** were stitching limbs back on while the fans were so pickled they were trying to tackle the moving trees! The **Open Bar** has turned the bleachers into a literal sea of swaying, shouting rangers! 🍺🏥  The second half saw the Chaos Creatures find a spark of life! **Urata Oriana**, fresh from his pre-game weapon-testing, found a gap in the defense and launched a beautiful **2-point Shoot**! It cut the lead to 4-2 and for a fleeting moment, the rebellion looked alive! But the Wardens are as immovable as an old oak tree when the title is on the line! 🎯🤘  The brutality reached a fever pitch late in the game! **Normi Glaudia**, despite the boots being on the wrong feet, absolutely demolished **Wolbrom Ariella**! Wolbrom was sent to the infirmary with a crunch that echoed off the Warden’s Watch! I haven't seen someone hit the turf that hard since I was set free from my prison! 🏥🔨  Then **Ema Ulrick** decided to finish what she started, leveling **Raouf Dragone** and sending them straight to the healers! The Chaos Creatures were dropping like flies in a plague-house! If this is what 'heroism' looks like, I’ll take the rebels any day—at least they have better gravy! 🚑💥  In the final moments, the Wardens played a game of keep-away that would make **Falric** proud. Chaos tried to rally, but **Teria Ravo** and **Affra Yanaton** were walls of steel. When the final whistle blew, the scoreboard read 4-2. The \"heroes\" have won the series and the championship, proving that popularity and fancy weapons actually count for something! 🏆  What a season, Osterra! **Sir Randy**’s rangers are going to be celebrating with ritual sangria for a month! The Chaos Creatures gave us a bracket reset for the history books, but tonight, the Oak stands tall! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most beautiful bloodbath in the realm! Stay violent, sports fans! 🔥🤘","week":5,"homeScore":4,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-10-5-oak-and-onslaught-new-monteforte","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Placido Kora in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella passes the ball to Urata Oriana, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Center Field","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but Urata Oriana blocks it!","Fogel Raynold throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Fogel Raynold in zone Center Field","Mouldon Earl tries to Tackle Teria Ravo, but Teria Ravo blocks it!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but misses!","Teria Ravo Tackles Tucker Hett and INJURES THEM!","Mouldon Earl passes the ball to Gabriele Klehm!","Mouldon Earl shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Alben Diantha in zone Center Field","Wolbrom Ariella passes the ball to Urata Oriana, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Ema Ulrick in zone Center Field","Abner Seidel shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Center Field","Normi Glaudia tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but misses!","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but misses!","Urata Oriana throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Normi Glaudia in zone Home Field","Symer Crissy tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Milt Casady, but Milt Casady blocks it!","Symer Crissy throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Wolbrom Ariella!","Hole Bowerman tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but Raouf Dragone blocks it!","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Fogel Raynold throws a wild pass and it is INTERCEPTED by Teria Ravo!","Ema Ulrick shoots from Home 2-Point and SCORES!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Gabriele Klehm in zone Center Field","Alben Diantha tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Abner Seidel tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but misses!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Millham Evangeline, but Millham Evangeline blocks it!","Urata Oriana shoots from Center Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Center Field","Wynnie Faina tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Fogel Raynold runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Mouldon Earl, but Mouldon Earl blocks it!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Placido Kora tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Urata Oriana throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Home Field","Raouf Dragone runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Normi Glaudia tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but Fogel Raynold blocks it!","Normi Glaudia Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Milt Casady tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Ema Ulrick Tackles Raouf Dragone and INJURES THEM!","Fogel Raynold passes the ball to Alben Diantha, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Urata Oriana in zone Home 2-Point","Alben Diantha passes the ball to Placido Kora, but they drop it!","The Trollball is picked up by Teria Ravo in zone Home 2-Point","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Hole Bowerman, but misses!","Teria Ravo tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Affra Yanaton tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but misses!","Milt Casady shoots from Home 2-Point but misses the goal!"],"bracket":"Grand Finals"}
