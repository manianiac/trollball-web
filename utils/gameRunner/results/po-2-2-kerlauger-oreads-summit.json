folks! It’s your favorite voice from the void, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the eerie, mist-choked ruins of The Old Fort! We are deep in the heart of the Winners Bracket, and let me tell you, the playoff atmosphere is thicker than the fog rolling off these ancient stones! The Oread's Summit Tamers are sitting pretty with a 1-0 lead in this Best of 3 series, and if they take it today, the Kerlauger Runeguard will be packing their bags for the Losers Bracket faster than Sir Tanos runs from a book! \n\nDown on the field, the rituals are in full swing! I see Saloma Talich of the Tamers getting absolutely hammered in the shoulder by a teammate—now that’s how you wake up the nerves! Meanwhile, the Runeguard’s own Lashondra Niehaus is doing the same; it’s a regular punch-fest down there! Johnna Beetner is prowling the perimeter, adding another pebble to her collection from these ancient ruins. She’s going to need more than luck to handle the Tamers today, especially with the 'Ancient Ruins' modifier making every step a potential ankle-snapper! \n\nThe crowd is hushed, or maybe they're just lost in the 'Dense Fog,' but you can feel the tension! Dame Terra Monteforte is watching from the high stones, looking as stern as a schoolmarm at a mud-wrestling match. Can the Runeguard use their home-field advantage to force a Game 3, or will the Tamers provide us with the beautiful sight of a series sweep? The runes are glowing, the troll head is twitching, and the violence is about to begin! Let’s get to the mayhem! 🦴💥","postGame":"# 🏆 Post-Game Report: Tamers Sweep the Series! 🏔️\n\nGreat gobs of gore, what a finish! The Oread's Summit Tamers have done it, folks! They’ve marched into the fog of Kerlauger and emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over the Runeguard, clinching this Winners Bracket series 2-0! It was a tactical masterclass in brutality that would make Lord Orzalon weep with pride! The Kerlauger Runeguard put up a fight, but they’ll be heading down to the Losers Bracket to contemplate their failures while the Tamers climb higher toward glory! \n\nThe action kicked off with Saloma Talich snagging the troll head right out of the gate in Center Field! The Tamers wasted no time showing why they’re the favorites. Swamy Ahasuerus tore through the fog like a banshee, and before the Runeguard could even find their footing on the 'Uneven Footing,' Zadoc Wyatan let fly a massive Shoot from Home Field! Swish! Two points for the Tamers, and the Runeguard were looking like they’d seen a ghost! \n\nBut oh, the violence that followed! Dric Trilley decided Lashondra Niehaus didn't need to be standing anymore, delivering a tackle that sent her straight to the healer’s tent! The Tamers were on a warpath! Mitran Mariand followed up by absolutely leveling Vivia Namara. It was like watching a butcher shop during a fire sale—bodies everywhere! The Runeguard's offense was sputtering in the 'Dense Fog,' unable to string a pass together without a Tamer turning them into a rug!\n\nMitran Mariand wasn't done, folks! He caught Johnna Beetner trying to escape with a pebble in her pocket and sent her to the sidelines with a crunch that echoed off the ancient standing stones! The Runeguard were dropping like flies! Even Reginauld Cordell couldn't catch a break, as Edme Virgil Tackled him into the dirt just before the half. It was a symphony of destruction that would make Sir Artorias blush—if that celebrity could even remember what a real fight looked like! \n\nWe went into Halftime with the Tamers leading 2-0 and the Runeguard looking like they’d been through a meat grinder. But credit where it’s due, Eal Caundra worked some magic in the tent! When the whistle blew for the second half, the Runeguard showed a flicker of life! Gurney Fadiman scooped the ball, and Vivia Namara, back from the brink, made a desperate dash into the End Zone for a Touchdown! The score narrowed to 2-1, and for a moment, I thought we might actually see a comeback! \n\nHowever, the Oread’s Summit defense tightened up faster than a hangman’s noose! Kass Fogel secured the ball in Center Field and the Tamers began a brutal game of keep-away. Every time the Runeguard tried to mount an attack, the terrain or a Tamer stopped them cold. Harilda Sigsmond managed to take out Odericus Juxon, but it was too little, too late. The Runeguard were fighting the fog as much as their opponents! \n\nThe frustration was palpable! Odericus Juxon tried to put the game away with a Shoot from Home Field but missed, sending the ball skittering into the mist. Johnna Beetner tried one last desperate pass to save their playoff lives, but the clock was the real enemy here. The Runeguard were running out of time and healthy bodies to throw at the problem! \n\nIn the final moments, Zadoc Wyatan decided to put an exclamation point on the victory by crushing Reginauld Cordell one more time! Talk about adding insult to injury! Reginauld's going to be feeling that one well into next season! The Runeguard fans—all zero of them in the stands—must be devastated, while the Tamers celebrate a series well-won! \n\nFinal Score: Oread's Summit Tamers 2, Kerlauger Runeguard 1. The Tamers move forward in the Winners Bracket, looking like the juggernaut we all suspected they were! They didn't even need the thin air of the mountains to suffocate the competition today; they just used good old-fashioned steel and grit! \n\nAs for the Runeguard, they’ll have plenty of time to collect pebbles in the Losers Bracket. Maybe Dame Terra Monteforte can use some of her dirt wizardry to bury the memory of this loss! They’ll need a miracle and a lot more armor if they want to survive the next round. I hope they enjoy the long walk home through the mud! \n\nThis has been Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that in Trollball, if you aren't bleeding, you aren't trying! Congratulations to the Tamers for the sweep! Tune in next time when we see who else gets their dreams crushed under a spiked boot! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🏟️💀🔥","week":2,"homeScore":1,"awayScore":2,"slug":"po-2-2-kerlauger-oreads-summit","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Saloma Talich in zone Center Field","Swamy Ahasuerus runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Zadoc Wyatan shoots from Home Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Lashondra Niehaus in zone Center Field","Dric Trilley Tackles Lashondra Niehaus and INJURES THEM!","Mitran Mariand tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but Gurney Fadiman blocks it!","Clippard Burr tries to Tackle Lon Gabriell, but Lon Gabriell blocks it!","Mitran Mariand Tackles Vivia Namara and INJURES THEM!","Edme Virgil tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Dric Trilley tries to Tackle Benjie Foulk, but misses!","Odericus Juxon tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but misses!","Lon Gabriell throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Harilda Sigsmond in zone Center Field","Mitran Mariand Tackles Johnna Beetner and INJURES THEM!","Lon Gabriell tries to Tackle Odericus Juxon, but Odericus Juxon blocks it!","Kass Fogel tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but misses!","Shepperd Trefler passes the ball to Harilda Sigsmond!","Reginauld Cordell runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Edme Virgil tries to Tackle Lashondra Niehaus, but misses!","Harilda Sigsmond tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Alwyn Wandy tries to Tackle Benjie Foulk, but misses!","Zadoc Wyatan tries to Tackle Reginauld Cordell, but misses!","Odericus Juxon tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but misses!","Kass Fogel tries to Tackle Benjie Foulk, but Benjie Foulk blocks it!","Edme Virgil Tackles Reginauld Cordell and INJURES THEM!","Lorilee Aldred runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Kass Fogel tries to Tackle Benjie Foulk, but misses!","Swamy Ahasuerus tries to Tackle Vivia Namara, but misses!","Gurney Fadiman tries to Tackle Zadoc Wyatan, but misses!","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Gurney Fadiman in zone Away 2-Point","Vivia Namara tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Odericus Juxon tries to Tackle Lashondra Niehaus, but Lashondra Niehaus blocks it!","Vivia Namara runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Kass Fogel in zone Center Field","Clippard Burr tries to Tackle Benjie Foulk, but Benjie Foulk blocks it!","Lon Gabriell tries to Tackle Odericus Juxon, but misses!","Odericus Juxon tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Vivia Namara tries to Tackle Clippard Burr, but misses!","Harilda Sigsmond Tackles Odericus Juxon and INJURES THEM!","Zadoc Wyatan runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Harilda Sigsmond tries to Tackle Clippard Burr, but misses!","Gurney Fadiman tries to Tackle Edme Virgil, but Edme Virgil blocks it!","Vivia Namara tries to Tackle Mitran Mariand, but Mitran Mariand blocks it!","Edme Virgil tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Odericus Juxon shoots from Home Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Edme Virgil in zone Home Field","Benjie Foulk tries to Tackle Zadoc Wyatan, but misses!","Vivia Namara tries to Tackle Odericus Juxon, but misses!","Odericus Juxon throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Johnna Beetner in zone Home Field","Alwyn Wandy tries to Tackle Johnna Beetner, but misses!","Dric Trilley tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Dric Trilley tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Lon Gabriell runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Lashondra Niehaus tries to Tackle Odericus Juxon, but misses!","Zadoc Wyatan Tackles Reginauld Cordell and INJURES THEM!","Lon Gabriell passes the ball to Johnna Beetner!"],"bracket":"Winners"}
