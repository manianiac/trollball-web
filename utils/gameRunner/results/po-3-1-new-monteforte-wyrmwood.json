No, I’m not talking about the Feast of the Harvest, I’m talking about the Playoffs! 🏆 We are live at 'The Unruly Yard' in New Monteforte for Game 1 of the Losers Bracket, where the stakes are higher than a Warlock’s ego! The atmosphere here is absolutely electric—and I don’t just mean the literal sparks coming off the unstable scaffolding. The graffiti is fresh, the crowd is already throwing bricks, and the smell of impending violence is sweeter than a corrupted soul! 😈\n\nOur visitors today, the Wyrmwood Stronghammers, have emerged from the mines looking for blood! I saw their healer, Hamburger Marthe, preparing for the match by seeing how many dried beans he could fit in his nostril. 👃 That’s the kind of dedication to personal excellence we love to see in Trollball! Meanwhile, their heavy hitter Sabian Gleason was seen counting clouds in the sky. It’s a peaceful hobby for a man who plans to turn his opponents into a fine red mist with a maul! ☁️\n\nBut don't count out the home-town favorites, the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures! They’ve got the home-field advantage here in the mud and the chaos. Placido Kora was seen telling a series of terrible jokes to the Trollball itself to 'loosen it up'—which is frankly more terrifying than any curse I’ve ever seen! ⚽ And look at Wolbrom Ariella over there, singing a sea shanty so out of tune it’s practically a war crime. If the Stronghammers don't kill them, the singing might! 🎶\n\nThis is a Best of 3 series, folks, and neither of these teams wants to slip further down the bracket. While I’ll always have my heart with the Ebon Gate Corruptors—and a healthy disdain for those sparkly bores in the Haven Lights—I have to admit, there’s nothing like the smell of a stadium riot to get the morning started! Let’s get to the action! 💥","postGame":"Great Greasy Golems, what a display of sheer, unadulterated carnage! 😵 If you like your sports with a side of internal bleeding, then New Monteforte was the place to be tonight! The Chaos Creatures defended their home turf with a 3-0 victory over the Stronghammers, but the score doesn't even begin to tell the story of the broken bones and bruised egos left on the field! 🏟️\n\nThe action started with a bang when Raouf Dragone snatched up the Trollball, only to be immediately introduced to the business end of Sabian Gleason’s maul! Sabian absolutely leveled the poor devil, sending him straight to the infirmary before the game could even get warm! 🔨 It was a beautiful, crunchy tackle that reminded me why I love this game more than a stack of unpaid bar tabs! \n\nThe Wyrmwood boys weren't finished there, oh no! Godart Urissa decided Gabriele Klehm’s face was looking a bit too symmetrical and proceeded to fix that with a devastating tackle. Gabriele was out for the count, proving that even at 'The Unruly Yard,' the visitors aren't afraid to make a mess! 🥊 It's enough to make a demon weep with joy, seeing such beautiful aggression right out of the gate!\n\nBut the Chaos Creatures aren't just here to look pretty in their graffiti-covered jerseys! Alben Diantha showed us all how it’s done, weaving through the defense like a rogue fleeing a debt collector and dunking that leather head right into the goal! 🏀 That first point sent the crowd into such a frenzy I think I saw a street performer get thrown into a mine shaft! 1-0 for the home team, and the blood was just starting to flow!\n\nThe Stronghammers tried to rally, but the Chaos Creatures’ defense was as stubborn as a White Raven refusing to admit they’re wrong! Raouf Dragone, back from the brink, got some sweet revenge by absolutely clobbering Calvinna Isador. It was a textbook hit that left Calvinna seeing more stars than a drunk astrologer! ⭐ The violence was truly the star of the show today, just the way we like it!\n\nBy the time Halftime rolled around, the field looked more like a butcher's shop than a stadium. But thanks to the wonders of the Everwar, everyone popped back up with a fresh face and a convenient lack of memory regarding their previous skull fractures! 🔄 It’s a wonderful system, really. It allows for twice the violence with none of the permanent paperwork! \n\nIn the second half, things got even weirder! Cornela Piscatelli was out there handing out injuries like they were participation trophies, taking Alben Diantha out of the play with a sickening thud! 🦴 Not to be outdone, Sondra Elaina from Wyrmwood decided Boulanger Procto needed a long nap and delivered a tackle that would have made Sir Garon Ironrock proud—if he wasn't too busy staring at a door somewhere! 🚪\n\nThe highlight of the evening, however, had to be Ultun Barthelemy! This man went on a absolute rampage, delivering a double-header of destruction! He injured Wolbrom Ariella and Tucker Hett in back-to-back plays! 💥 Two knockouts for the price of one! If I had a hat, I'd throw it onto the field, but I don't want to lose it to the rowdy crowd—they’ve already stolen three microphones and a healer’s arming sword!\n\nDespite the Stronghammers' best efforts to turn the game into a wrestling match, Gabriele Klehm delivered the final blow. From deep in the Away Field, Gabriele took a shot that sailed through the goal for two massive points! 🎯 It was a display of skill that felt almost out of place amidst all the beautiful stabbing and punching. That brought the final tally to 3-0 for the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures!\n\nSo, Game 1 goes to the home team! The Wyrmwood Stronghammers have their work cut out for them if they want to stay in this series. They need to spend less time counting clouds and more time counting their teeth! 🦷 We’ll be back for Game 2, and you can bet your last copper it’s going to be even bloodier! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the muddiest, rowdiest yard in Osterra! Stay brutal, fans! 😈🏒","week":1,"homeScore":3,"awayScore":0,"slug":"po-2-1-new-monteforte-wyrmwood","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Raouf Dragone in zone Center Field","Tucker Hett tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Sabian Gleason Tackles Raouf Dragone and INJURES THEM!","Autumn Jodoin tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but Fogel Raynold blocks it!","Godart Urissa Tackles Gabriele Klehm and INJURES THEM!","Odelia Abbott tries to Tackle Fogel Raynold, but Fogel Raynold blocks it!","Sabian Gleason tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Calvinna Isador tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but misses!","Boulanger Procto tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Alben Diantha passes the ball to Wolbrom Ariella!","Sabian Gleason tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Kerwin Gasper tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Boulanger Procto runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Alben Diantha runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Autumn Jodoin in zone Center Field","Cornela Piscatelli throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Kerwin Gasper in zone Center Field","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Kerwin Gasper, but Kerwin Gasper blocks it!","Cornela Piscatelli tries to Tackle Alben Diantha, but misses!","Godart Urissa passes the ball to Calvinna Isador!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Ultun Barthelemy, but misses!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Kerwin Gasper, but misses!","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Wolbrom Ariella, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Raouf Dragone Tackles Calvinna Isador and INJURES THEM!","Cornela Piscatelli shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Wolbrom Ariella in zone Center Field","HALFTIME - Each team has a quick break, and all injured players are returned to play","The Trollball is picked up by Fogel Raynold in zone Center Field","Ultun Barthelemy tries to Tackle Gabriele Klehm, but Gabriele Klehm blocks it!","Wolbrom Ariella throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Boulanger Procto in zone Center Field","Boulanger Procto tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Placido Kora runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Autumn Jodoin tries to Tackle Raouf Dragone, but Raouf Dragone blocks it!","Kerwin Gasper tries to Tackle Boulanger Procto, but Boulanger Procto blocks it!","Fogel Raynold tries to Tackle Godart Urissa, but Godart Urissa blocks it!","Cornela Piscatelli Tackles Alben Diantha and INJURES THEM!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Sabian Gleason, but misses!","Boulanger Procto shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Away Field","Cornela Piscatelli tries to Tackle Urata Oriana, but misses!","Sondra Elaina Tackles Boulanger Procto and INJURES THEM!","Placido Kora shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Mouldon Earl in zone Away Field","Rebane Kendy tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Ultun Barthelemy Tackles Wolbrom Ariella and INJURES THEM!","Ultun Barthelemy Tackles Tucker Hett and INJURES THEM!","Gabriele Klehm shoots from Away Field and SCORES!","The Trollball is picked up by Cornela Piscatelli in zone Center Field","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Rebane Kendy, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Autumn Jodoin, but misses!","Mouldon Earl Tackles Odelia Abbott and INJURES THEM!","Autumn Jodoin shoots from Center Field but misses the goal!"],"bracket":"Losers"}
