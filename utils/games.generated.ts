    "preGame": "# 🎙️ LIVE FROM THE OSTERRA AIRWAVES! 🎙️\n\nStep right up, ladies and gentlemen, ghouls and ghosts! This is your favorite demon of the dial, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the edge of a caravan oasis at the **Sun-Baked Bowl**! ☀️ We are in the final week of the regular season, folks, and the tension is thicker than a swamp-ogre's neck! Today, we've got a real humdinger as the **Confluence Captains** travel down from their mountain high-rises to face off against the **The Desert Spectres**! \n\nNow, look at this crowd! Or lack thereof! It seems the Spectres haven't quite captured the hearts of the masses like those Zmeigorod Snessengers, but who cares about popularity when you've got blood in the sand? 🏜️ The heat is absolutely oppressive—I can see the sweat boiling off the players already! The Captains are looking fancy, likely funded by that 'kissless virgin' Brennen Farno and his Guild of the Black Sky. I hear they're building a Skyport, but can they build a winning strategy? \n\nKeep an eye on the pre-game rituals, folks! Over in the Captains' dugout, **Ladew Evelina** just chugged a raw egg—shell and all! That's the kind of grit I love! Meanwhile, **Belding Chloe** is rubbing the Trollball on her armpits for that 'extra grip.' It's disgusting, it's foul, it's Trollball! On the Spectres' side, **Angelita Darce** is shaving exactly half of his mustache. Why? Because it’s the playoffs, baby! 🪒 Grab your hats and hold onto your souls, because we are about to see some beautiful, unadulterated carnage!",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 FINAL REPORT: CRUNCHING BONES IN THE CANYON! 🏆\n\nWhat a display of magnificent mayhem we just witnessed, Osterra! The **Confluence Captains** have secured a 2-0 victory over the **Desert Spectres**, and they did it with the kind of ruthless efficiency that would make my boss, Lord Orzalon, shed a single, oily tear! It was a low-scoring affair, sure, but the medical tent is absolutely overflowing, and isn't that why we all tune in? 🏟️\n\nThings started off with a real laugh when **Steve** for the Spectres picked up the ball and immediately dropped it like it was a hot coal! You’d think with a name like Steve, she’d have more coordination, but that’s the 'hero' luck for you—all flash and no finish! 📉 **Ladew Evelina** was quick to capitalize, snatching that troll head up and putting the Captains on the offensive while the Spectres' defense looked like they were trying to tackle shadows in a sandstorm.\n\nThe highlight of the first half was undoubtedly **Belding Chloe**. After blocking a desperate tackle from Steve, she stepped back in the Home Field and let it fly! **SWISH!** A 2-point shoot that silenced the dunes! 🏀 She’s been rubbing that ball in her pits all morning, and clearly, the scent was too much for the Spectres to handle! That gave the Captains a lead they would never relinquish, much to the chagrin of Geth the Gravelord and his desert-dwelling disappointment!\n\nBut let's talk about the real action—the violence! **Muscolo Jaehne** gave us a thrill by absolutely leveling **Vonni Geoff**, sending him to the infirmary with a sickening crunch! 🦴 That’s what I like to see! The Spectres were playing angry, but the Captains’ defense, led by **Stephan Lisk**, was a brick wall. Lisk even snagged a wild pass from Steve, turning a Spectres drive into a total disaster. The Guild must be proud—or at least as proud as those money-grubbing priests can be!\n\nAt halftime, the healers did their dirty work, dragging the broken bodies back onto the field. **Verlee Dacia** was busy sweetening the Spectres with honeycomb, but it didn't help their aim! **O'Conner Maighdlin** tried to extend the Captains' lead with a shot from center field, but it went wide! It seems rhyming for an hour before the game doesn't actually help your depth perception, who would've guessed? 🤡\n\nThe second half turned into a literal hospital ward! **Angelita Darce** came out swinging that bardiche and put **Carnahan Laud** on the ground! 🏥 Not to be outdone, **Belding Chloe** decided she wasn't done being the MVP and absolutely wrecked **Shelman McQuoid**. The sand was turning a lovely shade of crimson, and I was sitting here with a grin wider than a Cheshire Cat! It’s just a shame the Haven Lights weren't here to get pummeled too!\n\nThe Spectres tried to rally, but their luck was drier than the Great Desert. **Bahr Ethelstan** tried to make a run for it, but the Captains' defense swarmed him like flies on a carcass. Every time the Spectres thought they had an opening, someone like **Caves Cestar** was there to intercept the ball or deliver a punishing blow. It was a masterclass in mountain-grown brutality!\n\nIn the closing moments, the carnage reached a fever pitch! **Carnahan Laud**, back from her injury, decided to share the pain and took out **Muscolo Jaehne**! Then, just for good measure, **Ladew Evelina**—the egg-chugging queen herself—tackled **Fidellia Mozelle** so hard her ancestors felt it! 🍳 Three Spectres players were down and out by the final whistle. If this were a popularity contest, the Spectres would be buried, but in a fight, they at least went down swinging!\n\nSo, there you have it! **Confluence Captains: 2, Desert Spectres: 0.** The Captains are heading into the playoffs with momentum and a lot of sticky Trollballs! The Spectres are heading home to lick their wounds and maybe teach their dogs some more 'useless tricks' like Eileen Mikihisa. 🐕\n\nDon't forget to tune in next week for the playoffs, folks! I’ll be rooting for my beloved **Ebon Gate Corruptors** to tear through the competition like a hot knife through butter! And as for those 'heroes' of the realm? Tell Sir Tanos to keep his Sunbringer away from my radio booth, or he might find out what a real demon tackle feels like! 🎤\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the Sun-Baked Bowl! Stay nasty, Osterra! 🤘",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ Welcome to the Season Finale, Sports Fans! Well, hello there, boys and girls, demons and deviants! It is a glorious, blood-soaked Tuesday night in the Everwar! I'm your host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the atmospheric (and quite frankly, crumbling) ruins of **The Old Fort** in Kerlauger! The fog is so thick you could carve it with a sacrificial dagger, and the footing is about as steady as a hero's moral compass! 🌫️💀\n\nTonight we have a real humdinger of a match-up! The **New Prosperity Profits** are in town, and I can tell you, the Merchant's Guild has spared no expense on the pre-game festivities. I just saw Yoshi Cathy polish off a whole raw onion without shedding a single tear—that's the kind of cold-blooded determination that makes a demon’s heart skip a beat! Meanwhile, over in the Profits' dugout, Abramson Doxia is sharpening a blunted sword. It’s a completely futile exercise, much like trying to get a straight answer out of Chairman Brennen Farno, but you’ve gotta love the spirit! 🧅⚔️\n\nBut don't count out our hosts, the **Kerlauger Runeguard**! They’ve been busy with their own rituals. Johnna Beetner is wandering the field collecting pebbles—maybe she’s planning on stoning a saint later? We can only hope! And listen to that! Harilda Sigsmond is leading a synchronized chant that’s getting louder by the second. It’s enough to wake the dead, which, in Osterra, happens about every twenty minutes anyway! 🪨🗣️\n\nAnd the best part? It’s an **OPEN BAR** tonight! The taps are wide open, and the ale is flowing faster than the river Styx! Whether you're a fan of the Profits' gold or the Runeguard's ancient stones, everyone’s going home blurry-eyed—if they go home at all! It's the final week before the playoffs, and the tension is high enough to snap a dragon’s neck! Let’s get some Trollball action! 🍺🏈",
    "postGame": "### 🏟️ A Drunken Masterpiece at the Old Fort! \n\nWhat a way to close out the regular season! If you like your sports with a side of staggering and a heavy dose of blunt-force trauma, tonight was your Christmas! The Kerlauger Runeguard didn't just win; they dismantled the New Prosperity Profits with a final score of **8 to 1**! It was a performance so dominant it would make Sir Garon Ironrock blush—if that old door-lover had any blood left in his cheeks! 🏰💥\n\nThings started fast and loose when Lashondra Niehaus snatched up the Trollball right in the center. But the highlight of the early minutes was Krueger Jacinthe of the Profits absolutely leveling Shepperd Trefler! The sound of that impact was like a choir of angels hitting a brick wall. That’s the kind of 'heroic' action I love to see—just pure, unadulterated violence! 🎺👊\n\nOnce the open bar started taking its toll, the game turned into a beautiful, swaying ballet of chaos. Lon Gabriell opened the scoring for Kerlauger with a beautiful long-range shot from the home field. I haven't seen a shot that accurate since Nikos Thanae last cleared a sidewalk! The crowd went wild, and the players went straight for the kegs! 🎯🍻\n\nThe fog and the booze really started to mix when Vivia Namara, looking remarkably tipsy, put another one through the hoop! It’s hard enough to hit a basket in this fog, but doing it while the stadium is spinning? That’s professional grade, folks! The Profits looked like they were swimming in gold-plated molasses. 🌫️😵‍💫\n\nThe Profits did manage one shining moment of glory. Boleslaw Heathcote, stumbling around in a drunken stupor that would impress even the most seasoned pirate, managed to advance the ball all the way to the end zone for a thunderous dunk! It was their only point of the night, but by the Great Abyss, it was a pretty one! 🏀🔥\n\nHowever, the Runeguard defense was just too much. Faina Hendrix decided he’d had enough of Reginauld Cordell's face and sent him to the healer's tent with a tackle that surely rattled some teeth! I bet even Colm, that cursed fellow, felt that one from wherever he’s hiding! The violence was top-shelf, just like the liquor! 🚑🤕\n\nHalftime came and went, but the sobriety didn't return! If anything, the break just gave everyone a chance to refill their mugs. Lorilee Aldred came out swinging—literally—tackling Aufmann Tedric so hard that the poor Profit had to be hauled off the field. It’s a good thing we have healers, or there wouldn't be anyone left to pay the bar tab! 🍺🔨\n\nAs the second half wore on, the Runeguard just poured it on. Vivia Namara scored again, this time from the 2-point line, looking like she was seeing three goals and luckily aiming for the middle one! The Profits' defense was as porous as Brennen Farno’s excuses for his 'kissless' status. It was a total breakdown of guild discipline! 📉🤡\n\nBenjie Foulk joined the party late in the game, nailing another shot from center field while practically horizontal! By this point, half the players were stumbling around in a daze, and the other half were trying to tackle the standing stones thinking they were opponents. The 'Ancient Ruins' modifier really adds a layer of danger when you're three sheets to the wind! 🏺🥴\n\nThe game ended with Shepperd Trefler—miraculously back from his injury—taking a wild shot that missed by a mile, but who cares? The Runeguard had already secured the blowout! A staggering 8-1 victory for the home team, leaving the Profits to count their losses instead of their coins tonight. 💰🚫\n\nSo, as we head into the playoffs, keep your eyes on Kerlauger! If they can play this well while intoxicated, imagine what they’ll do when there's a trophy on the line! And to the New Prosperity Profits: maybe next time, spend a little less on the pre-game onions and a little more on tackle practice! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! Stay brutal, Osterra! 💀🏁",

    "preGame": "# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL PRE-GAME REPORT! 🎙️\n\nHello there, sports-fiends and blood-letters! This is Nok the Corrupter coming to you live from the stone ramparts of the Stronghold Bailey! We’ve got a real humdinger today as the popular New Ravenfall Commanders host the Oread's Summit Tamers in the final week of the season! The air is thick with anticipation and the scent of fermented fish—courtesy of Theis Loredo’s pre-game snack ritual! 🏰🏟️\n\nThe Commanders are looking to please their massive fanbase here in New Ravenfall, but the Tamers aren’t just here for the mountain scenery! I caught Swamy Ahasuerus dipping her hands in a bucket of ice-cold well water to numb the pain she's about to deliver! Meanwhile, Alwyn Wandy is over there whispering secret fears to the Trollball. I hope that ball likes horror stories, because it’s about to see some real terror on these cobblestones! ❄️🪓\n\nAnd don't forget, folks—it’s an **OPEN BAR** tonight! The ale is flowing faster than the blood, and that’s saying something in Osterra! Whether you're a fan of Sir Tanos and his Eponore bunch or you just like seeing people get clobbered, this is the place to be! The castle echo is going to make every bone-snap sound like a symphony! Let's get to the carnage! 🍺💀",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 THE FINAL WHISTLE HAS BLOWN: TROLLBALL RECAP! 🏆\n\nWhat a night of absolute mayhem at the Stronghold Bailey! The cobblestones are slick with more than just spilled mead, and the castle walls are still ringing from the impact of armored bodies hitting the ground! It was a defensive masterclass and a brutal display of mountain-man strength as the Tamers silenced the Ravenfall crowd! 🏰🩸\n\nThe action started fast with Saloma Talich snatching the Trollball in Center Field, dodging Theis Loredo like a demon escaping a priest! The Commanders tried to set the tone early with their physical play, but the Tamers' front line held firm against the initial surge of the Eponore-backed favorites.\n\nThen came the first real taste of blood! Jozef Pepe, wielding a Zweihander with the grace of a falling boulder, absolutely leveled Clippard Burr! The injury was magnificent—Burr went down and didn't get back up until the healers intervened. That's the kind of spirit we like to see in the final week! ⚔️💥\n\nBut the Tamers wouldn't be bullied in the Stronghold! Kass Fogel took offense to the roughhousing and delivered a retaliatory strike that sent Rhett Gavrilla straight to the infirmary! Not to be outdone, the Commanders' Estes Adrian cracked Odericus Juxon’s helmet right open. It was a glorious exchange of hospital passes and heavy metal! 🏥🔨\n\nBy halftime, the **Open Bar** was clearly the most popular player on the field! While most of these 'heroes' were starting to sway like wheat in a storm, I noticed Jozef Pepe and Dric Trilley were still standing straight. A impressive display of alcohol tolerance, or perhaps they’re just too stubborn to admit they’re seeing double! 🍺🥴\n\nThe silence of the home crowd was deafening when the highlight of the night occurred! Alwyn Wandy, perhaps fueled by those whispered fears, lined up a shot from Center Field. With a heave that would make a giant weep, the ball sailed through the goal! **TWO POINTS** for the Oread's Summit Tamers! 🎯🔥\n\nThe Commanders tried to claw back, but the second half was a graveyard of dreams. Dusa Curson managed to knock Kass Fogel out of the game, but the Tamers' defense was an iron wall. Dric Trilley returned the favor by sending Jozef Pepe to the dirt with a thunderous tackle that likely shook the Governor-King Zenku’s throne! 👑📉\n\nOne of the most embarrassing moments for the home team came when Croteau Osmo tried a desperate pass, only for it to be snatched right out of the air by Swamy Ahasuerus! Swamy’s ice-cold hands didn't fumble that one, effectively killing any hope of a Ravenfall comeback. 👐🏈\n\nAs the clock wound down, Edme Virgil continued the assault, putting Theis Loredo on the injury list with a nasty War Pick strike. Even as Jozef Pepe tried one last-ditch effort to break Swamy Ahasuerus, the Tamers simply laughed in the face of the Commanders' fading glory. 🏔️💪\n\nFinal Score: **The Oread's Summit Tamers 2, The New Ravenfall Commanders 0!** A total shut-out! The popular crowd is heading home disappointed, much like Sir Artorias when he realizes his fey friends can't save him from a good old-fashioned mountain beating! Stay tuned for the playoffs, sports fans—it’s only going to get bloodier from here! 🎙️👹",

    "preGame": "# 🏟️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL AT THE FRONTIER! Step right up, sports fans, and brace yourselves for a real bone-chilling spectacle! It’s Nok the Corrupter here, coming to you live from the South Pole Palisade, where the wind is howling and the mud is harder than a dwarf's skull! It’s the final week of the season, and the air is thick with the scent of pine and impending medical bills! We’ve got a real clash of cultures tonight, folks! On one side, those goody-two-shoes from the Temple of Light, The Haven Lights, are looking far too clean for my tastes! I spotted Zwart Bunns whispering a secret fear to the trollball earlier—probably telling it how much he hates the cold! And Shiroma Salim is over there obsessively re-taping his shield handle. Do they think a little leather will save them from a Yeti's mallet? I doubt it! On the other side of the frozen pitch, we have our hosts, the South Pole Yetis! Now these are my kind of people! Udela Dorkus was seen licking a whetstone in the dugout—that’s the spirit of Trollball right there! And keep an eye on Selima Si, who’s wearing her lucky garish undergarments today! I hope they’re wool, because this Freezing Rain is no joke! This crude log stockade they call a stadium is currently under the Wolf Pack Howling modifier, and let me tell you, those wolves sound hungry for more than just victory! I hope Imra the Master of Elixirs has her bar tab ready, because after this match, the players are going to need more than just a healing spell to forget the frostbite! Let’s see if those Haven 'heroes' like Sir Tanos' friends can handle a real frontier fight! It’s time to play some Trollball! 🏔️🥅🏈",
    "postGame": "## 🏔️ CRUNCH TIME AT THE PALISADE: HAVEN HITS HARD! What a display of absolute carnage we just witnessed, folks! My ears are still ringing with the sound of snapping timber and even louder snapping collarbones! The Haven Lights might have walked away with a 4 to 2 victory, but the South Pole Yetis turned that frozen field into a crimson slushie! It’s a real shame those Temple-dwelling light-lovers won, but you can’t argue with the brutality they displayed! 🩸 The action started with a bang when Ajit Serge absolutely leveled Tybi Reo, sending her straight to the healer before the first whistle had even cooled! But the Lights didn't blink; Berkin Waters launched a surgical shot from Center Field, putting those shiny boys on the board early with two points! The Yetis weren't taking it lying down, though! Coussoule Bidle decided Marlane Lounge needed a nap and delivered a tackle that would have made Lord Orzalon proud! 🔨 Then came the speed! Sayers Erdda charged through the Icy Field like a runaway wagon, dunking the ball into the goal and making the log palisade shake! The crowd—what few were brave enough to face the Freezing Rain—went absolutely wild! But the Lights' Coward Tarton showed some real defensive greed, snagging a wild pass out of the air like a common street thief! 🧥 After the halftime reset, where the healers worked overtime to stitch the Yetis back together, the blood really started to flow! Dickenson Beker decided revenge was best served cold, crunching Hilaire Guevara into the mud! Shiroma Salim then showed us why he's a name to fear, scoring another two-point shot and then immediately sending Jessy Debbie to the dirt! 🩹 It was a revolving door for the healers! Riffle Heyde, who drinks lukewarm water like a weirdo, proved they have a mean streak by knocking Sale Tocci right out of the match! Despite the Yetis finding one last burst of energy for a Duky Orelee dunk, the Lights were just too clinical in their violence! 💀 Wieren Ivar put the final nail in the coffin, delivering a bone-shattering tackle to Isborne Krause that had the wolves howling in approval! Even that little guy Cinnemon would have been shaking in his tiny boots seeing the hits these Yetis took! 🍷 It’s a bitter pill to swallow seeing the Haven Lights clinch this one, but credit where credit is due—they left a lot of Yeti teeth on the ice! The popularity of these teams might be low, but the level of physical trauma was top-shelf! If Elspeth Ortell has that ritual sangria ready, I suggest the Yetis drink the whole bowl! Final score: Haven Lights 4, South Pole Yetis 2! We’re heading into the playoffs, savages, so sharpen your axes and stay corrupted! 🏆😈🔥",

    "preGame": "Step right up, sports fans, ghouls, and battle-hardened veterans! It is a glorious, salt-crusted Tuesday evening here at the Cliffside Pitch in Southport, and boy, do we have a doozy for the final week of the season! I am Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live where the gale-force winds are currently trying to whistle a tune through my ribs, and the sea spray is giving the Trollball a lovely, slippery sheen! We are perched right on the edge of oblivion, folks—one bad step and you are shark bait! It is the Brimstone Fire Eaters taking on our hosts, the Southport Narwhals, in a match that promises more broken bones than a necromancer's workshop!\n\nNow, look at these Fire Eaters! They hail from the Su'akour Bowl, and you can tell by the way Glassman Solley is currently washing his hands with dirt—a classic ritual for a man who loves a Rondel Dagger and a face full of grime! Meanwhile, Nachison Icken has her boots on the wrong feet for the warm-up! That is the kind of chaotic energy that would make even my old pal Sir Tanos blush, and we all know that man hates a letter but loves a good stabbing! The Fire Eaters are looking to burn down the house, and I for one am rooting for the team that brings the most heat to this freezing cliffside!\n\nBut don't count out King Nezmear’s favorites just yet! The Southport Narwhals are looking sharp, literally! Loralyn Lyndy is over there adjusting her codpiece with the kind of theatrical importance you usually only see at a God-King Artorias coronation! And keep an eye on Cilurzo Sochor, who is currently whispering a heroic backstory to the leather troll head. I hope that head likes tragedy, because it is about to be punted into a basket! The fans might be a bit sparse today—I suppose everyone is home tending to their werewolves or feeding Elizabeef the werecow—but the atmosphere is electric with the threat of imminent injury!\n\nThere is no open bar today, folks, which is a crying shame for those of us who like our violence with a side of rotgut, but the players are sober and ready to slaughter! Will the Fire Eaters’ voodoo weather rhymes from Nigel Rothmuller carry them to victory, or will the Narwhals use those rocky outcroppings to cheese a win? It is the last stop before the playoffs, and the Everwar is heating up! Strap in, keep your shields up, and let’s get this Trollball rolling! It’s going to be a real humdinger of a homicide!",
    "postGame": "Hey-ho, what a display of athletic carnage! The whistle has blown, the spray has settled, and the Southport Narwhals have defended their cliffside with the ferocity of a cornered crab! The final score stands at Narwhals 2, Fire Eaters 0, and my horns are still buzzing from the sheer impact of those collisions! It was a masterclass in linear brutality, and while my favorites from the Fire Eaters couldn't find the basket, they certainly found plenty of bruises to take home as souvenirs!\n\nThe action kicked off with Loralyn Lyndy snagging the ball in Center Field, and from that moment, the Narwhals were moving like a greased lightning bolt! Braden Gaile made a dash for the goal that would have made even the circus-escapee Sawyer jealous, but the Fire Eaters’ defense held firm for a moment. However, the Narwhals’ persistence paid off when Blanc Fantasia—a man who clearly knows his way around a Seax—looted a pass over to Cibis Areta. Cibis didn't hesitate, dunking that troll head into the goal like it was a naughty goblin! 1-0 for the home team, and the wind howled in approval!\n\nBut the real story of the first half was the absolute wreckage in the trenches! Malcolm Goer decided that Nigel Rothmuller’s ribs were surplus to requirements, delivering a tackle that left the spear-wielder seeing stars and visiting the healer! And oh, the beauty of the violence didn't stop there! Fineman Dolhenty went on a absolute rampage, knocking Orlina Jerrine and Selimah Tully right out of their boots! It was a symphony of agony that would have brought a tear to Lord Orzalon's eye if he weren't currently cooling his heels in prison! The Fire Eaters were dropping like flies, folks!\n\nJust when you thought the Fire Eaters might mount a comeback, Loralyn Lyndy showed off some of that 'codpiece confidence' by intercepting a wild pass from Campball Fink! It was a theft so brazen it would make the Guild of the Black Sky proud. Despite the noxious fumes and the slippery sea spray, the Narwhals kept their composure. Even with the lack of alcohol, the players were stumbling around like they’d spent the night at one of Imra’s dust-heavy parties, thanks to the relentless wind and the pounding they were taking!\n\nHalftime came just in time for Raphael Miyasawa to kiss a few more biceps and get the Fire Eaters back on their feet. But the second half was more of the same Southport dominance! Cilurzo Sochor might have dropped the ball once or twice, probably busy narrating the troll head's internal monologue, but the Narwhals didn't let up. Malcolm Goer continued to be a one-man wrecking crew, clearing a path through the dirt-stained Fire Eaters like a plow through a graveyard!\n\nThe nail in the coffin came when Blanc Fantasia, showing the kind of grace Sir Artorias usually reserves for fey-slaying, found Cibis Areta once again in the End Zone! Another dunk, another point, and the Narwhals were sitting pretty at 2-0! The Fire Eaters tried to retaliate, with Wylde Jutta delivering a bone-crunching tackle to Crescint Sonia that sent the Warhammer-wielder to the sidelines, but it was too little, too late. The Brimstone boys just couldn't find the range on their shots, with Bollinger Susette missing a long-distance prayer that sailed wide enough to hit a passing seagull!\n\nBy the closing minutes, the field was a mess of salt, sweat, and shattered dreams. Cibis Areta, not content with scoring, decided to add 'injury to insult' by flattening Lowson Hersh. And just to put a bow on it, Fineman Dolhenty ended the game by taking out Wylde Jutta! It was a bloodbath, pure and simple! The Narwhals played like they had the goddess Oona herself cheering from the lighthouse, while the Fire Eaters looked like they’d spent too much time communicating with birds and not enough time catching the ball!\n\nSo, as the sun dips below the horizon and the werewolves of Southport start their nightly choir, we wrap up the regular season! The Narwhals take the win, the Fire Eaters take the bandages, and we all take a moment to appreciate the glorious lack of sportsmanship! My heart sinks for the Brimstone crew, but you can't win 'em all when you're wearing your boots on the wrong feet, can you?\n\nTake heart, Eponore fans, there is always the playoffs to look forward to! Perhaps Sir Tanos will stop stabbing me long enough to give the team a pep talk. But for now, the Narwhals are the kings of the cliff! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most dangerous linear field in Osterra! Keep your blades sharp and your healers closer!\n\nFinal Score: The Southport Narwhals 2 - The Brimstone Fire Eaters 0. What a day for a murder, stay tuned for the playoffs, folks! It’s going to be absolutely demonic!",

    "preGame": "Greetings, ghouls, ghosts, and gladiators! This is Nok the Corrupter coming to you live from the Prismatic Pavilion! It’s the final week of the regular season, and the atmosphere is thicker than a swamp hag's stew! We’re perched right over the Starlight Lagoon, and I tell you, the footing is as shaky as a hero’s moral compass! 🌊 The Oak & Onslaught have arrived, and they are looking to pulverize! I saw Normi Glaudia and Wynnie Faina warming up with their boots on the wrong feet—now that’s the kind of chaotic energy I love to see! Meanwhile, Symer Crissy is whispering sweet heroics to the trollhead, giving it a backstory before she uses it to bash some skulls! 🏟️ On the home side, the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres are putting on quite the show! Quintessa Austine is out there trying to get a slow clap going with a crowd that’s mostly here to see the Wardens’ favorites get flattened! Kristin Kronfeld is getting punched in the shoulder by her teammates, and Pompei Hephzipa is striking poses that would make a gargoyle blush! It’s a real sell-out crowd for the Onslaught, while the Bizarres’ section looks a bit like a graveyard at midnight—quiet and empty! Let’s get to the carnage! 🛡️💥",
    "postGame": "What a crackerjack of an afternoon of absolute mayhem! The Prismatic Pavilion nearly collapsed under the weight of all that beautiful violence! The Bizarres started things off with a bang when Willa Lois took a shot from center field and sent that trollhead sailing right through the hoop for two points! 🎯 It looked like the flashy performers of the circus had the upper hand, but the Onslaught isn't a team that stays down for long! The violence really ramped up when Willa Lois absolutely crunched Abner Seidel, sending him to the healer with a nasty injury! 🚑 And just to keep the blood flowing, Gagliano Tallbott took out Wynnie Faina right before the break! But don't you worry, fans, Ema Ulrick was there to clean up the mess, dunking the ball twice in the first half to keep the Onslaught in the hunt! 🩸 \n\nHalftime saw everyone get patched up by the healers, including Ahron Latashia who I’m sure was just drawing more circles in the dirt! When we came back, it was the Millham Evangeline show! Millham stepped up to center field and hammered home a two-point shoot that had the crowd roaring! 📣 The Bizarres tried to make a comeback when Melesa Zelten danced through the defense for a dunk, but the shifting terrain of this pavilion is a cruel mistress! I saw Gagliano Tallbott running like the wind, only for the defense to shut him down! 🎭 The drama peaked when Wynnie Faina got some revenge, tackling Aggri Cookie so hard I think I saw a few teeth fly into the lagoon! 🦷 Millham Evangeline wasn't finished, though, sinking another magnificent two-point shot from Away 2-Point to put the nail in the coffin! Final score: Oak & Onslaught 6, Starlight Bazaar Bizarres 3! 🏆 \n\nA dominant victory for the Warden’s finest, even if Sir Randy’s presence in the stands makes my skin crawl! I’d much rather be watching my Ebon Gate Corruptors tear the Haven Lights limb from limb, but this was a decent substitute for a Tuesday night! The Bizarres might have the flair, but today they just had the floor—mostly because they were being pinned to it by a mallet or a blackjack! The crowd for the Onslaught is absolutely electric tonight, cheering every broken bone like it was a gold coin! It’s a shame the Bizarres couldn't find their footing on these unstable planks, but that's Trollball for you—one minute you're posing, the next you're floating in the lagoon! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most beautiful bloodbath in Osterra! See you at the playoffs, if you survive the night! 😈🔥",

    "preGame": "# 🏟️ WELCOME TO THE BUCCANEER'S BOWL! 🏟️\n\nGreetings, boils and ghouls! Nok the Corrupter here, coming to you live from the sun-drenched, blindingly bright Buccaneer's Bowl at the Toast Island Resort! We're in the final week of the season, folks, and the tension is thicker than a swamp hag's stew! On one side of the line, we've got **The Greenwatch**, those nature-loving Wardens who probably spend more time hugging trees than hitting people! I saw Madea Mensch hopping to the line with his laces tied together—talk about a handicap! And look at Nariko Javed wiggling those fingers; if that's magic, I'm a paladin! It's enough to make a demon weep with boredom!\n\nOver in the home dugout, **The Tortell Privateers** are looking lean, mean, and ready to pillage! Lilithe Royce is currently sticking leeches to her legs to 'lighten her step'—now that's the kind of bloodletting I love to see! 💉 Dib Tufts just downed a raw egg, shell and all, a real breakfast of champions! While Elspeth Ortell might be mixing up some of her 'ritual sangria' for the resort guests, these Privateers are thirsty for something much redder! Even that puppet kraken in the bay looks intimidated by the violence about to unfold!\n\nThis stadium is a real piece of work, isn't it? Imported turf and 'Resort Security'—I'd like to see those rent-a-cops try to stop a rampaging troll! With the playoffs looming, both teams are fighting for a spot in the history books of Osterra. Will the Greenwatch's 'Ritual Focus' save them, or will they be blinded by the sun and the sheer brilliance of the Privateers? Let's get this carnage started! 🏈💀",
    "postGame": "# 🏴‍☠️ THE PRIVATEERS PLUNDER A VICTORY! 🏴‍☠️\n\nWhat a finish, folks! What a beautiful, brutal display of Trollball here at the Buccaneer's Bowl! The Tortell Privateers have sailed away with a 6 to 4 victory over the Greenwatch in a match that went all the way to a heart-stopping overtime! It was a real barn-burner, or should I say, a ship-sinker! 🚢💥\n\nThe game kicked off with a flurry of activity in the Away Field! Castorina Gies snatched up the troll head like a pirate claiming buried treasure! Payson Jan tried a wild pass that went nowhere—probably too much of Elspeth's sangria—but Melisande Eustacia was there to clean up the mess and keep the Privateers' momentum alive! The Greenwatch players looked like they were still trying to communicate with the birds!\n\nThe defense for the Greenwatch was looking stout early on, with Darin Berliner putting on a theatrical display of aggression, blocking Dib Tufts and Kidder Starkey with the flair of a stage actor! I haven't seen that much posturing since Sir Artorias last looked in a mirror! But Loralee Sunny wouldn't be denied, charging toward the goal with her war scythe glinting in that blinding resort sun!\n\nThe highlight of the first half had to be Keisling Damalas! He lined up from the 2-point zone and let it rip! 🎯 Splash! Two points for the Privateers! He didn't stop there, immediately diving back into center field to reclaim possession! That's the kind of initiative that makes a demon proud! Keisling was playing like he had the luck of the Abyss on his side!\n\nThe Greenwatch tried to fight back, with Rese Halpern grabbing the ball and Drona Jacklin making a desperate run for the goal, but the Privateers' defense was like a stone wall! Even Troy Jorgan's attempts to advance were shut down faster than a Haven Lights prayer meeting! Those 'heroes' from the Wardens were looking more like 'zeros' out there on the sand!\n\nThen came the real fireworks! Lilithe Royce, probably powered by those leg leeches, absolutely leveled Madea Mensch! 🦵💥 The crack of bone echoed across the imported turf as Madea was sent to the infirmary! It was a masterpiece of violence that would make even Sir Randy's fancy bow snap in half with envy! Madea's ritual of tying his laces together clearly didn't help him stay on his feet!\n\nNot to be outdone, Dib Tufts decided to leave his mark before the whistle! He lunged at Verne Methuselah and delivered a tackle so ferocious it left Verne seeing stars and nursing a one-way ticket to the healer's tent! 🏥 That's how you play the game, folks! No mercy, no prisoners! If the ball carrier is breathing, you aren't hitting hard enough!\n\nWe headed into overtime tied up, and the atmosphere was electric! Both teams got their wounded back, thanks to the tireless work of Nariko and Eugen, but the exhaustion was showing! Melisande Eustacia secured the ball early in the extra period, setting the stage for the final act while the resort guests watched in slack-jawed horror! 🍹😵\n\nThere was one last gasp of defiance from the Greenwatch! Troy Jorgan finally got his hands on Dib Tufts and sent him packing with a brutal injury of his own! Revenge is a dish best served on a Trollball field, even if it came a little too late to save the match! It's just a shame it wasn't a member of the Haven Lights on the receiving end!\n\nThe end came when Payson Jan took aim from the Home Field and hammered home the winning score! The crowd of distracted tourists actually stopped looking at the puppet kraken for five seconds to cheer! 🐙 The Greenwatch are headed back to the woods with nothing but bruises, while the Privateers are celebrating a hard-earned win with some high-quality plunder!\n\nIn the end, the Wardens just couldn't handle the heat! Maybe if Sir Randy spent less time polishing his 'fancy' equipment and more time teaching his squad how to take a hit, they'd be heading into the playoffs with more than just sore heads! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the Buccaneer's Bowl! Stay nasty, Osterra! 😈🏈",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ HELLO OUT THERE IN RADIOLAND! TUNE YOUR DIALS TO TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! 🎙️\n\nBoy howdy, folks, have we got a real humdinger for you today! It’s the final week of the regular season on the plane of Osterra, and the air is thick with the smell of sweat, ozone, and—if my nostrils don't deceive me—freshly tilled dirt! We are coming to you live from **The Hollow Mine** in Wyrmwood Hollow, where the ground is literally humming with energy! I haven't felt a buzz like this since Morgwae and Artorias busted me out of the Demon Prison to save that grumpy Sir Tanos! The vines are tangling, the mine draft is chilling, and the violence is about to be THRILLING!\n\nToday, my absolute favorites, the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, are looking to soil the reputation of the **Wyrmwood Stronghammers**! I saw Bullion Iglesias back in the locker room, meditating so silently you could hear a flea sneeze—he’s got that killer focus! Meanwhile, over in the home dugout, Godart Urissa is insisting on wearing an oversized, floppy hat during warm-ups. It’s a fashion choice that would make even the high-and-mighty Count Trez Arrigo blush, but in this league, it’s all about the hits, not the hats! \n\nWe’ve got a stadium full of fans—mostly Grove types, probably hoping for a 'clean' game. HA! Not on my watch! The Corruptors are ready to leave a mark, and I don't mean an autograph. Terle Chenay is leading the Corruptors out after a locker room belching contest that nearly shook the stands! Will the Stronghammers' 'Humming Earth' be enough to stop the impending corruption? Or will the vines of Wyrmwood be the only thing left standing? Grab your favorite beverage and don't blink, because this is Trollball, where the only thing that regenerates faster than the players is the excitement! 🏈💀⚡",
    "postGame": "### 🏟️ WHAT A SPECTACLE OF SPLATTER! THE SEASON FINALE IS IN THE BOOKS! 🏟️\n\nHoly cow, fans! If you didn't enjoy that, you don't have a pulse—and in this realm, that's saying something! It was a back-and-forth slugfest that saw more blood than a butcher's apron! My beloved Ebon Gate Corruptors came out swinging, with Ellette Paz snatching up the troll head like a hungry demon at a banquet! They didn't waste any time, as **Simsar Carrelli** lined up a shot from Center Field and zipped it right through the goal for an early 2-0 lead! The Corruptors were firing on all cylinders, just the way I like it!\n\nBut oh, the brutality didn't stop there! Calvinna Isador of the Stronghammers decided to get personal, tackling Smith Syst so hard the healer had to be called in! But you can't keep a good Corruptor down! As Utter immediately retaliated, flattening Isador into the humming earth! It was a symphony of crunching bones that would have made Geth the Gravelord weep with joy! The first half was a whirlwind of missed passes and broken bodies, leading us into a halftime break where the healers definitely earned their keep.\n\nAfter the break, the Stronghammers seemed to find their footing in those tangled vines. Cornela Piscatelli—who, I might add, spent pre-game braiding a teammate's nose hair—turned that focus into a devastating tackle on Ahasuerus An! The momentum shifted like a landslide in the mine! **Ultun Barthelemy** found an opening from the Home Field and let fly a shot that tied the game up! My heart nearly stopped, and I don't even need one!\n\nThen came the heartbreak for the Ebon Gate faithful. Bullion Iglesias, usually so reliable, threw a wild pass that was snagged right out of the air by Rebane Kendy! The interception of the century! The Stronghammers were on the move, and despite Judi Carrington's best efforts to turn Calvinna Isador into a permanent fixture of the turf, the defense couldn't hold. **Sabian Gleason** broke through the line, clambered into the End Zone, and slammed that troll head home for a touchdown! 🏆\n\nThe Corruptors tried for a desperate late-game surge with Simsar Carrelli, but the clock and the Stronghammer defense were just too much. The home crowd—all those Grove-loving leaf-munchers—went wild! I’m sure High Priestess Oona is somewhere smiling, which is enough to make a demon want to vomit. \n\nFinal Score from the Hollow Mine: **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers 3, The Ebon Gate Corruptors 2.**\n\nIt’s a tough pill to swallow for the Ebon Gate boys. They played with the kind of malice that usually earns you a promotion in the Demon Prison! But the Stronghammers used every bit of that mine draft and humming earth to their advantage. \n\nLet's talk about those 'heroes' for a second. While guys like Sir Tanos are out there stabbing things and being 'bold,' these players are out here actually working for a living—mostly by hitting each other with maces and axes! It's a shame the Corruptors couldn't close it out, but that's the beauty of the sport. One minute you're the hammer, the next you're the troll head! \n\nThe stadium was a factor all night. Those tangled vines caught more players than the actual defenders did! I saw Napoleon Anzovin thanking his armor after a particularly nasty spill, and he's going to need a lot more than armor to recover from this one. The Stronghammers might have the win, but they're going to be feeling those Corruptor bruises well into the playoffs!\n\nDon't let the loss get you down, Corruptor fans! We're headed into the post-season, and if there's one thing I know about Ebon Gate, it's that they always come back nastier than before! They'll be polishing their boots with bacon grease and dreaming of revenge! \n\nWhat a way to end the regular season! We saw interceptions, we saw dunked heads, and we saw enough injuries to fill a dozen regeneration pits! This is Nok the Corrupter signing off from the booth. Remember: in life, you win some and you lose some, but in Trollball, everyone gets hit! Goodnight, Osterra! 🎙️👹🏈",

    "preGame": "Greetings, boils and ghouls! Step right up to the edge of your seats because we are coming to you live from the soggy, sinking, and absolutely spectacular Serpent's Pass! I'm your host, Nok the Corrupter, and boy oh boy, do we have a humdinger for you today! It is the final week of the regular season, and the air is thick with the smell of swamp gas and anticipation! Our home team, the Zmeigorod Snessengers, are the talk of the realm! Everyone from the Bog Queen Valos to the common muck-dweller is out today to support these serpentine superstars. On the other side of the field, we have the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures, led by that dirt-wizard Dame Terra Monteforte. They might not have the crowd on their side, but they've got enough grit to fill a quarry! 🏟️🐍The rituals are underway and they are a sight to behold! I just saw Waldon Tadeo rubbing some truly foul-smelling mushrooms on her elbows—that's the kind of dedication to flexibility I love to see! Meanwhile, Delija Dowling is chugging raw eggs, shell and all! Over in the Chaos Creatures' camp, Lian Denton is knocking back a shot of hot gravy from a dented tin cup, and Wolbrom Ariella is treating us to a sea shanty that is so out of tune it might actually be a form of psychological warfare! It is wet, it is wild, and the altitude is already making the players' lungs burn! Whether it's the rockslides or the sudden downpours, something is going to break today, and I hope it's a femur! Let’s get ready for some Trollball! 🏈💀",
    "postGame": "What a magnificent display of carnage we witnessed today at the Serpent's Pass! The Zmeigorod Snessengers didn't just win; they orchestrated a symphony of destruction that would make even Geth the Gravelord weep with joy! The final score stands at a dominant 4 to 0 in favor of the home team, and the crowd is absolutely losing their minds in the swamp! It was a masterpiece of violence from the very first whistle! 🐍🏆The action kicked off with Delija Dowling snatching up the leather head, but the real fireworks started when Arni Griffith absolutely flattened Placido Kora! The medical tents were overflowing before the first ten minutes were up! We saw Northway Orran and Evalyn Pierrepont handing out injuries like they were holiday gifts, sending Mouldon Earl and Alben Diantha to the sidelines for some much-needed reconstruction! 🏥💥The Chaos Creatures tried to fight back, with Gabriele Klehm pulling off a spectacular interception from Alded Sanjay, but they just couldn't find the basket! It seems kissing the Trollball for luck doesn't help much when you're being hunted by Machete-wielding maniacs! The altitude and the sinking turf clearly played a factor, as the Chaos Creatures looked like they were running through molasses while the Snessengers moved like greased lightning! ⚡🏃‍♂️Just when things looked like they might settle down, Northway Orran decided she had seen enough of the scrum! From the 'Away 2-Point' zone, she launched a beautiful shot that sailed through the air and through the goal! Two points on the board just like that! It was a throw so precise it would make Sir Tanos' head spin, assuming he could read the scoreboard! 🎯🔥The second half was even bloodier! Raouf Dragone and Gabriele Klehm tried to lead a comeback, but the Snessengers' defense was a brick wall. Avaria Revell and Kleinstein MacGregor were absolutely relentless, knocking Chaos Creatures out left and right! At one point, we almost had a forfeit because the Creatures had so few players left standing! It was beautiful, pure Trollball chaos! 🌪️🩸Alded Sanjay put the nail in the coffin later in the game, sinking another massive 2-point shot from distance! The Chaos Creatures were left reeling, their aesthetically pleasing gear spirals ruined and their sea shanties silenced. Even the interceptions by Dare Wynnie and Fogel Raynold couldn't stem the tide of Zmeigorod's overwhelming popularity and power! 🌊🚫I have to wonder if the 'heroes' of the realm are watching this? While people like Cinnemon are busy spreading the curse of literacy, these warriors are out here doing the real work of breaking bones and taking names! If only the Haven Lights had half the backbone shown by these Snessengers today, maybe they wouldn't be such a disappointment! 🙄💩The Chaos Creatures had their chances, with Boulanger Procto and Raouf Dragone getting close to the goal, but their shots just wouldn't find the mark. Perhaps if they spent less time telling jokes to the ball and more time practicing their aim, the scoreline wouldn't be so lopsided! But hey, that's the beauty of the game! 🤡📉As the sun sets over the swamp and the stadium continues its slow descent into the muck, the Zmeigorod Snessengers stand tall! They are heading into the playoffs with all the momentum of a rockslide! The fans are cheering, the mead is flowing, and the Bog Queen herself must be grinning ear to ear! Zmeigorod is the place to be, folks! 🥳🐍Final thought for the night: If you're going to lose, at least lose with enough injuries to make the healers work for their pay! The Chaos Creatures certainly did that, even if they forgot how to score! We'll see you all for the playoffs, where the stakes are higher and the hits are harder! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from a very wet, very bloody Serpent's Pass! Goodnight and stay corrupted! 🎙️👹",
