    "preGame": "Hellllllo, sports fans and blood-lusting enthusiasts! This is Nok the Corrupter, your voice of chaos, coming to you live from the delightfully dank and sulfur-scented Su'akour Bowl! 🏟️ Can you smell that? That's the scent of the Brimstone Fire Eaters' home turf, and it smells like... well, mostly rot and bad decisions! 👃 Tonight we have the Wardens' own Oak & Onslaught visiting this crumbling fortress of filth to take on the local favorites! While I usually prefer the Ebon Gate Corruptors showing everyone how it's done, I suppose watching these Warden 'do-gooders' get their ribs cracked will have to suffice! 😈\\n\\nI've been watching the pre-game festivities, and boy, do we have some characters! Abner Seidel is currently sporting a pair of undergarments so garish they might actually blind the opposition before they can land a punch! 🩲 Meanwhile, Teria Ravo is warming up her skull by gently headbutting the goal post—that's the kind of dedication to a concussion I can really get behind! ✊ On the other side, Bollinger Susette is getting his teammates to punch him in the shoulder just to wake up, while Selimah Tully is desperately asking the referee to bless his dagger. Sorry, pal, the only blessing you're getting today is the sweet release of a knockout blow! 🗡️\\n\\nMilt Casady is leading the Wardens in a synchronized chant that’s getting louder by the second, probably trying to drown out the sound of the crumbling walls! 🧱 Will Sir Randy’s favorite rangers prove they have the grit to survive the Noxious Fumes, or will the Fire Eaters turn them into compost? It’s a glorious day for a bit of the old ultra-violence, so grab your snacks and prepare for the carnage! Let's get to the Trollball! 🦴🔥",
    "postGame": "What a spectacular display of grit, gristle, and glorious carnage we witnessed today at the Su'akour Bowl! 🏟️ The Oak & Onslaught managed to walk away with a 2-0 victory, leaving the Brimstone Fire Eaters wondering if they should have spent less time communicating with birds and more time blocking! 🦅 It was a shutout for the Wardens, and while I hate to give credit to anyone associated with Sir Randy and his fancy bow, they certainly brought the pain today! 🏹\\n\\nThe match kicked off with a flurry of fumbles that would make a goblin blush, but the violence started in earnest when Wylde Jutta absolutely flattened Teria Ravo! 💥 It was a beautiful sight to see Teria's pre-game headbutting put to the ultimate test, even if it ended with her being hauled off the field for an early nap! Wylde Jutta really showed that the Fire Eaters have plenty of spice in their system! 🌶️\\n\\nNot to be outdone, Bollinger Susette decided that Wynnie Faina didn't need to be upright anymore! 🥊 He delivered a tackle that sent Wynnie straight to the sidelines, proving that getting punched in the shoulder during warm-ups really does wonders for your aggression! It's the kind of sportsmanship that brings a tear to a demon's eye, folks! 🥲\\n\\nBut the highlight of the entire game came from Hole Bowerman! Despite the uneven ground and the stench of sulfur, she lined up a shot from the Home Field and absolutely nailed it! 🎯 That's a 2-point 'Shoot' that silenced the rowdy Brimstone crowd! I haven't seen a trajectory that impressive since Artorias tried to jump over a moon—though Hole actually succeeded in her goal! 🌕\\n\\nThe Fire Eaters tried to retaliate immediately, with Lowson Hersh delivering a crushing blow to Hole Bowerman, putting the scorer right out of the game! 🏥 Talk about a short-lived celebration! Lowson stared at that blade of grass before the game and clearly found the motivation to plant Hole right into it! 🌿 It’s the circle of life here in Osterra, and it’s usually quite bloody! 🩸\\n\\nWe saw some incredible hands out there—and I'm not just talking about the ones being severed! Symer Crissy showed off some 'heroic' reflexes by intercepting a wild pass from Bollinger Susette! 👐 Later on, Abner Seidel mirrored the feat by snatching a pass from Selimah Tully! I guess those lucky undergarments really do have some magic in them, even if they are an eyesore! 🩲✨\\n\\nAt halftime, the healers Ahron Latashia and Raphael Miyasawa were busier than a necromancer in a graveyard! 🧟‍♂️ They were stitching, patching, and reviving players left and right. Raphael even managed to get Nachison Icken back on her feet, only for the poor girl to find out the second half was going to be even more miserable than the first! 🩹\\n\\nThe second half belonged to Affra Yanaton, who was a one-woman wrecking crew! ⚔️ She must have read something particularly nasty in those knuckle bones this morning, because she laid out both Nigel Rothmuller and Campball Fink in quick succession! 🦴 It was a masterclass in using a longsword for something other than just looking heroic for the town criers! 📸\\n\\nEma Ulrick decided to put the final nail in the coffin by tackling Nachison Icken for the second time today! 🔨 Poor Nachison—it’s a miracle she can remember her own name at this point, let alone how to play Trollball. Ema showed no mercy, proving that even literacy can't save you from a Cutlass-wielding Warden when they've got their left gauntlet on first! 🧤\\n\\nIn the end, the Fire Eaters couldn't overcome the deficit, and the Wardens' defense held firm like a stubborn tree! 🌳 A 2-0 victory for Oak & Onslaught! Maybe if the Fire Eaters spent less time wiping sweat on their foreheads and more time catching the ball, they'd have a trophy to show for it! 🏆 Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter reminding you: if you aren't bleeding, you aren't trying! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🤘🔥",

    "preGame": "Step right up, sports fans, ghouls, and gladiators of Osterra! This is Nok the Corrupter coming to you live from the dizzying heights of the High-Pass Pitch! We are perched so high in the Oread's Summit that the air is thinner than a warlock's apology, but the excitement is thicker than a mountain troll's hide! Today’s Tuesday Night Trollball clash features the home-turf terrors, The Oread's Summit Tamers, squaring off against the high-society bruisers from the Guild of the Black Sky, The Confluence Captains! It's a real barnburner in the making, and I haven't been this giddy since Morgwae and Artorias busted me out of that dreary Demon Prison! Oh, what a day for a massacre!🎙️🔥\n\nLooking at our visiting Oread's Summit Tamers, these Prismatic Troupe favorites are bringing some truly delightful madness to the field. I just saw Odericus Juxon slapping her own helmet until her ears rang—now that’s the kind of brain-rattling dedication I love to see! Meanwhile, Alwyn Wandy is over there whispering secret fears into the leather troll head. I hope that head is listening, because it’s about to have a very rough afternoon! And keep an eye on Edme Virgil, who is currently serenading the mountain goats with a sea shanty so out of tune it’s practically a war crime! It’s marvelous! They’re certainly ready to paint the snow red! 🏔️🎶\n\nBut don't count out the Confluence Captains, backed by those kissless virgins and money-grubbing priests at the Guild! I spotted Ladew Evelina chugging a raw egg, shell and all—calcium is important when you're planning on snapping bones! And look at Belding Chloe, she’s rubbing the Trollball directly into her armpits for 'grip.' That's the kind of stinking ambition that wins championships, folks! They’ve got the Glowstone Glare on their side, but will it be enough to stop the Tamers from sending them home in pieces? Whether they’re eating dandelions like Carnahan Laud or wearing boots on the wrong feet like Deach Sharlene, these Captains are ready for a real scrap! Let the carnage begin! 🥚🛡️",
    "postGame": "Gather 'round, you bloodthirsty beauties, for a wrap-up of a game that was truly a feast for the eyes and a famine for the faint of heart! The Confluence Captains have defended their honor and their wallets with a narrow 3-2 victory over the Oread's Summit Tamers! It was a symphony of splinters and screams that would make even my old boss, Lord Orzalon, crack a smile in his cell! The Guild boys might be stuck-up, but they sure know how to swing a lance when the Glowstone starts to shine! 🏆💥\n\nThe action kicked off with a bang when Vonni Geoff absolutely leveled Kass Fogel, sending the Tamer to the sidelines for a quick chat with the afterlife! Carn Tibbetts had to work overtime early just to keep the Tamers on the field. I tell you, there’s nothing more refreshing than the sound of a Voulge hitting the turf and a player hitting it harder! The Confluence crowd was roaring, probably because they had bets on the first drop of blood! 🩸🏟️\n\nBut the Tamers weren't just here for the scenery! Despite being bullied by the Captains’ defense, they kept coming back for more punishment. Mitran Mariand was a favorite target today, getting absolutely crunched not once, but twice by Belding Chloe! That Chloe is a real menace with a lance, and I suspect that armpit-rubbing ritual gave her the 'musk of destiny' needed to dominate the mid-field! It was a beautiful display of organized violence that would make any demon weep with joy! ⚔️😭\n\nOur first score came from the Captains’ own Behl Berstine, who decided that running was better than fighting for a moment! Berstine tore through the defense and dunked that troll head right into the goal like it was a pile of gold coins! The Guild of the Black Sky must be thrilled—I bet Brennen Farno is counting the potential profits from the commemorative tapestries already! It was a 1-0 lead going into the half that felt like a punch to the gut for the mountain folk! 🏀🔥\n\nAfter a quick halftime to sweep up the teeth and regrow some limbs, the Captains came out swinging again! Belding Chloe, not content with just injuring people, decided to show off her arm. She took a shot from Center Field that sailed through the air like a cursed raven, scoring a massive 2 points! That's how you do it, folks! 3-0 for the home team, and the Tamers looked like they were ready to start reciting their grocery lists in despair! 🎯✨\n\nBut wait! Zadoc Wyatan of the Tamers wasn't ready to let the Guild have all the fun! In a desperate surge from the Away Field, Wyatan launched a beautiful shot that found the bottom of the basket for 2 points! Suddenly it was 3-2, and the mountain air was electric with the possibility of an upset! If only Swamy Ahasuerus had dipped her hands in colder water, maybe they could have found that final point, but the Captains’ defense held firm like a locked vault! 🏔️🙌\n\nI must give a shout-out to Clippard Burr, who managed to put Caves Cestar out of commission late in the game! It’s always nice to see the underdog get a few good licks in before the whistle blows. It’s a shame Cinnemon wasn't here to read the rulebook to them—maybe they would have realized they needed to score one more time! But alas, the clock is a cruel mistress, even in a world where death is just a temporary inconvenience! ⏳💀\n\nSo, the Confluence Captains walk away with the win! I’m sure Nikos Thanae is out in the streets celebrating by shooting at pigeons or whatever it is that 'benevolent' fellow does for fun. The Tamers are heading back up the mountain with nothing but bruised egos and a few extra holes in their jerseys. It’s a tough loss for the Prismatic Troups, but that’s the beauty of Trollball—there’s always next Tuesday to lose a limb! 🎭🚩\n\nAs for our 'heroes' of the realm, I didn't see Sir Randy or his fancy bow doing much to help today. Probably too busy polishing his arrows to get his hands dirty in a real sport! And where was Artorias? Likely off being a celebrity somewhere instead of enjoying a good old-fashioned head-butting. You lot really missed out on a spectacle of the highest order! The Everwar might be eternal, but a 3-2 nail-biter is a memory that sticks! 🏹🙄\n\nNo open bar tonight, which is a crying shame because I think Saloma Talich had the tolerance to drink the entire stadium under the table! We’ll have to settle for the intoxication of pure, unadulterated carnage! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the High-Pass Pitch! Join us next week when we’ll see if anyone can actually keep their head on their shoulders for more than ten minutes! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🎙️🖤",

    "preGame": "Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and ghouls! It’s a swell evening for some Tuesday Night Trollball! I’m Nok the Corrupter, and boy howdy, do we have a doozy for you! We’re coming to you live from the Sun-Baked Bowl, where the clay is hot enough to fry a cockatrice egg and the 'stands' are just blankets on the dunes! It’s the home-town Desert Spectres taking on my personal favorites—the meanest, toughest bunch of beauties in Osterra—the Ebon Gate Corruptors! 🏟️🔥\n\nNow, let’s talk about those Corruptors! I saw Smith Syst in the locker room earlier, and she was doing her usual thing, daring a teammate to eat a live worm! That’s the kind of grit you love to see, folks! Meanwhile, Bullion Iglesias was sitting in the corner like a statue, just meditating away. You can feel the focus! They’re looking to give those Spectres a real run for their money, and with Ellette Paz and her blackjack ready to go, I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that defense! 🪱🔨\n\nOn the other side of the field, the Desert Spectres are looking sharp—or at least half of them are! Angelita Darce has shaved exactly half of his mustache for this big game. It’s a bold look, folks, almost as bold as their boss, that ol' frenemy Geth the Gravelord! And keep an eye on Steve; she’s already got a betting pool going. I’d put my soul on the Corruptors, but then again, my boss Lord Orzalon might have something to say about that! Let’s get ready for some carnage! 🌵🎲",
    "postGame": "Holy smokes, what a humdinger of a match! The Ebon Gate Corruptors have pulled off a victory that would make even the grumpiest demon crack a smile! We started things off right after halftime with a frantic scramble in Center Field. Ellette Paz snatched up the troll head like it was a bag of gold, but the Spectres' defense was stickier than a spider's web! Judi Carrington tried to make a break for it twice, but those desert dwellers weren't budging! 🏈💥\n\nThings got spicy when Amedeo Bari tried to take a couple of long shots from Center Field. He missed the basket, sure, but the ambition was enough to give me goosebumps! The ball kept changing hands like a hot potato, and the tension was thicker than the mud at the Sinking Field. You could tell both teams were itching for a little of the old ultra-violence, and boy, did they deliver! 👏✨\n\nThen came the first big crack of the night! Shelman McQuoid of the Spectres decided Bullion Iglesias had been standing for too long and sent him straight to the infirmary! A real bell-ringer, folks! It looked like the Corruptors were in trouble when Amedeo Bari fumbled a pass to Simsar Carrelli, leaving the ball ripe for the picking. Bahr Ethelstan was there to scoop it up, much to the delight of the home crowd. 🤕🚑\n\nBut you can't keep a good Corruptor down! Ellette Paz decided it was time for some payback and absolutely leveled Heyes Iver! I haven't seen a hit like that since Sir Artorias tried to take on a mountain giant! The field was turning into a real scrap-heap. Not to be outdone, Muscolo Jaehne took out our very own Smith Syst, sending her to see Terle Chenay for some quick mending. It was a revolving door of pain! 🔨💢\n\nAs the game wore on, the Spectres tried to make their move. Eileen Mikihisa and Steve were darting toward the goal like thirsty camels toward an oasis, but the Corruptors' defense, led by Olnek Vizzone and Simsar Carrelli, held firm! Even with the intense heat of the desert sun beating down, our boys didn't break a sweat—mostly because they were too busy throwing shoulders! 🌵🏃‍♂️\n\nWe headed into Overtime with a goose-egg on the scoreboard, but the energy was electric! Both teams took a quick breather, and the healers were working overtime. Terle Chenay had Bullion and Smith back on their feet in no time, proving that Ebon Gate dental plans are second to none! The Spectres' Verlee Dacia was just as busy, patching up Heyes Iver for more punishment. ⏰⚡\n\nOvertime was a total free-for-all! Lovash Marius started things off by injuring Ellette Paz, but Smith Syst came back with a vengeance! She didn't just play the game; she dismantled the Spectres! She took out Heyes Iver again, then sent Bahr Ethelstan packing, and finally finished her rampage by injuring Lovash Marius! It was a masterclass in brutality that would make Geth the Gravelord weep into his gravel! 😈💀\n\nIn the midst of all that carnage, Steve managed to catch Bullion Iglesias off guard and sent him back to the sidelines. It was back and forth, hit for hit, a real test of who wanted that leather head more! The Spectres were looking to end it when Angelita Darce tried a wild pass, but oh boy, did he choose the wrong target! Olnek Vizzone read that play like a book and snatched the ball right out of the air! INTERCEPTION! 🏈👐\n\nWith the ball back in the Corruptors' hands, the momentum shifted for good. Olnek Vizzone charged forward, and while the Spectres tried to stop him, they were gassed! Smith Syst was still out there playing like a woman possessed, keeping the defense occupied. The Spectres were looking as confused as Sir Randy trying to find his way out of a paper bag! 📜🤔\n\nThen came the moment of glory! Simsar Carrelli found himself with an opening in the Away Field. He didn't hesitate, he didn't blink—he let that troll head fly! SWISH! A two-point shoot right into the basket! The Ebon Gate Corruptors take it 2 to 0 in a stunning display of skill and savagery! What a night for the fans of the Gate! Until next week, this is Nok the Corrupter saying: keep your weapons sharp and your healers closer! Goodnight, Osterra! 🏆🎉",

    "preGame": "Step right up, ladies and gentle-ghouls! 🏟️ It is a glorious Tuesday night in the Everwar, and we are live from the stone-cold ramparts of the Stronghold Bailey! I am your announcer, Nok the Corrupter, and holy smokes, do we have a humdinger for you tonight! The New Ravenfall Commanders are playing host to the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures in a match that promises more bone-cracking than a giant's breakfast! 🦴 \n\nI was down on the field earlier, and the pre-game energy is more infectious than a plague from Brennen Farno! I saw the Commanders' very own Jozef Pepe winning a belching contest that nearly shook the cobblestones loose—now that is what I call civic engagement! On the other side of the pitch, Wolbrom Ariella is currently singing a sea shanty so terribly out of tune it might actually be a new form of psychological warfare. 🎶 I love it! \n\nLook at the focus on Boulanger Procto as he meticulously arranges his gear in a perfect spiral—aesthetic and deadly! Meanwhile, Alben Diantha is dipping his hands in ice-cold well water, preparing to deliver some frosty hammers to the opposition's teeth! 🔨 Whether you are here for the White Ravens or the Eponore faction, we can all agree that seeing blood on these castle stones is the best way to spend a Tuesday! Keep your eyes peeled for Sir Tanos on the ramparts; I hear he’s looking for someone to stab, and golly, I hope it isn't me! Let's get to the action! 🛡️",
    "postGame": "What a spectacular display of organized mayhem, folks! 🏟️ The Commanders have defended their castle with a final score of 5 to 3 in a game that went the distance and then some! If you like your sports with a side of internal bleeding, this was the match of the century! \n\nThe game got off to a frantic start when Jozef Pepe scooped up the troll head, but the real fireworks began when Tucker Hett pulled off a magnificent interception from Moir Sass! It was a steal so clean it would make Dima the shadow king blush with envy! 🌑 \n\nThe violence was absolutely top-shelf tonight. Theis Loredo delivered a tackle on Urata Oriana that sounded like a sack of claymores falling down a flight of stairs! ⚔️ Urata was sent to the sidelines early, but thanks to the miracle of the Everwar and the hard work of healer Lian Denton, they were back in the fray before the blood even dried! \n\nWe saw Raouf Dragone make a valiant run, darting through the defense like a rogue escaping Sawyer’s circus, but Estes Adrian brought him down with a crunch that echoed off the castle walls! 🏰 That is the kind of commitment to the tackle that makes this demon's heart sing! \n\nThen came the moment for the Chaos Creatures! Gabriele Klehm didn't just find the end zone; she practically waltzed through the Commanders' line and dunked that troll head right into the goal! 🏀 A touchdown for the ages that had Dame Terra Monteforte cheering from the sidelines! \n\nBut we couldn't settle this in regulation, oh no! We headed into Overtime, where the real grit comes out! ⏳ Every broken bone was reset, and the players returned to the field hungrier for victory than a werewolf in King Nezmear’s kennel! \n\nIn the overtime heat, Jessalin Zobias became a one-person wrecking crew! He delivered back-to-back tackles that sent Mouldon Earl and Fogel Raynold straight to the dirt! 🪵 Poor Fogel looked like he’d been hit by a falling portcullis, and the Chaos Creatures' momentum was halted by the sheer brutality of it! \n\nThe Chaos Creatures tried to rally, with Alben Diantha and Urata Oriana making desperate runs, but the Commanders' defense held firmer than a door in Sir Garon Ironrock’s house! 🚪 A wild pass from Procto was snatched away by Dusa Curson, ending any hope of a Monteforte miracle! \n\nFinally, the play that will be talked about in every tavern from here to the Demon Prison! Theis Loredo, after a night of devastating hits, decided to end it with a flourish. From all the way back in the Home Field, she lined up a shot and sent that leather head sailing through the air! ☄️ \n\nSWISH! A two-point shot from distance to clinch the 5-3 victory for the Commanders! 🎯 Truly a finish that would make Geth the Gravelord weep with joy! Take that, you Haven Lights bores—this is how real athletes play! Now, if someone could help me avoid Sir Tanos on the way to the exit, I'd appreciate it! Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙",

    "preGame": "Hello, hello, hello! Step right up, sports fans, to a frost-bitten, bone-chilling Tuesday night Trollball extravaganza! This is Nok the Corrupter, your favorite demon of the airwaves, coming to you live from The South Pole Palisade! Whoo-ee! If you like your grass frozen into lethal shards and your stadium walls made of rough-hewn logs, you are in the right place! We've got a humdinger of a matchup between the Wardens' own favorites, The Greenwatch, and the local bruisers, The South Pole Yetis! The air is crisp, the wolves are howling, and the scent of iron-rich blood is already wafting from the end zones! 🏟️❄️  Before the whistle, I caught a glimpse of some truly professional preparation! Madea Mensch of the Greenwatch is currently hopping toward the starting line with his bootlaces tied together—now that is what I call commitment to a ritual! Meanwhile, Salahi Bushey is busy anointing his forehead with morning dew, though at this temperature, I suspect it is just frozen slush! Over in the Yetis' dugout, Udela Dorkus is literally licking a whetstone! Ha-ha! That's the spirit! And folks, let’s not forget the best part—tonight is an OPEN BAR! The ale is flowing faster than a river in spring, and the players are already looking quite festive! 🍻  The Greenwatch might have the backing of those high-and-mighty Wardens like Sir Randy—who I’m sure is somewhere polishing his fancy bow—but the Yetis have the home-field advantage of frozen mud! This is going to be a real corker of a contest where the only thing harder than the hits is the ice underfoot! Get your bets in, keep your eyes on the Trollball, and let’s get ready for some beautiful, beautiful carnage! It’s Tuesday Night Trollball! 🏈🔥",
    "postGame": "Holy Mackerel, what a magnificent display of drunken debauchery and shattered shinbones! The Greenwatch have absolutely dismantled the South Pole Yetis with a final score of 6 to 1! If you like seeing 'heroes' stumble around in a stupor while getting their teeth rattled, this was the game for you! The Wardens should be proud, or perhaps embarrassed, but either way, the Greenwatch walked away with the win and most of the beer! 🍻🏆  The action started early when Darin Berliner snagged the ball in center field, only for Rese Halpern to throw a pass so wild it looked like she was aiming for a bird! Sayers Erdda of the Yetis snagged the interception, proving that even a Yeti can catch if the ball is practically handed to them! But the violence truly began when Isborne Krause delivered a crushing tackle on Drona Jacklin, sending the Greenwatch player to the dirt with a satisfying crunch! That's what we call a South Pole welcome, folks! 🧊💥  But you can't keep a good demon-adjacent team down! After Nariko Javed worked some quick healing magic, Drona Jacklin hopped right back into the fray and fired a 2-point shot from the Home 2-Point line that sailed through the hoop like a phoenix! That goal triggered the first massive wave of drinking, and let me tell you, Goldenberg Rimola started looking a bit tipsy before the ball even hit the ground! The Greenwatch took an early lead and never looked back, leaving the Yetis wondering if the wolves outside the palisade were friendlier than the opposition! 🎯🍺  By the time we hit the second half, the open bar was taking a serious toll! Nobe Haukom, clearly feeling the liquid courage, drained another 2-point shot right from center field! At that point, the alcohol consumption hit critical levels. Jessy Debbie and Verne Methuselah were looking like they were trying to walk on stilts made of jelly! It was a beautiful sight, truly! If only Sir Randy could see his rangers now—they’d likely mistake his fancy bow for a very large toothpick! 🏹🥴  The Yetis did manage one moment of glory when Hilaire Guevara, absolutely plastered, went on a drunken tear through the end zone! She didn't just score; she practically dunked the ball with the strength of a frustrated frost giant! That brought the score to 2-1 briefly, but the comeback was shorter than a pixie's shadow. The Greenwatch responded by turning the field into a literal meat grinder! Darin Berliner and Verne Methuselah began a systematic campaign of destruction, injuring Selima Si and Ajit Serge in rapid succession! 🦾😤  The carnage was so absolute that the referees almost had to call the game early because the Yetis were running out of conscious players! Every time Seiter Aida managed to patch someone up, like Sale Tocci, the Greenwatch would immediately send them back to the dirt! Madea Mensch was tackling people while stumbling around like a man who’d seen the bottom of ten mugs! It was a masterpiece of aggressive intoxication! Even Coussoule Bidle tried a drunken run, only to be leveled by Darin Berliner in a hit that I’m sure King Nezmear's werewolves heard from leagues away! 🐺💥  I must say, seeing the Cedar Hill crowd's faces as their Yetis were systematically disassembled was worth the price of admission alone! Imra the Master of Elixirs might be good at making medicine, but she clearly didn't provide anything for a hangover of this magnitude! The Greenwatch players like Herriott Dhiren and Rese Halpern were handing out injuries like they were party favors, and the Yetis simply couldn't keep their feet under them! It was less of a sport and more of a demolition derby with more vomit! 🧪🤮  In the final moments, Drona Jacklin put the icing on the frozen cake with another 2-point shot, bringing the final tally to 6 for the Greenwatch! The Yetis were so far gone that Sale Tocci was seen drunkenly passing the ball to herself, which is a bold strategy that unfortunately doesn't count for points in this reality! The sheer level of intoxication was historical; I haven't seen this many 'heroes' horizontal since Lord Orzalon's last birthday bash in the Demon Prison! 🎂⛓️  While my favorite Ebon Gate Corruptors weren't on the field today, I have to give credit where credit is due—the Greenwatch played with a brutality that warms my cold, dark heart! They ignored the 'noble' path and chose the path of high-scoring violence and heavy drinking! They even made the South Pole Palisade look like a playground! Those poor Yetis are going to be feeling this in the morning, and not just in their bruised ribs! 🏥🩹  So, there you have it, folks! A 6-1 victory for the Greenwatch in a game that will be remembered more for the bar tab than the playbook! As the players are carried off the field—some because they're injured, most because they can't stand up—we bid you a fond farewell from the frozen frontier! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off and heading to the bar myself! Stay bloody, Osterra! 📻🖤",

    "preGame": "Hello there, sports fans! This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the windswept, bone-chilling heights of The Cliffside Pitch in Southport! 🎙️ Hellfire and brimstone, what a view! We’re perched right on the edge of the world where the sea spray stings like a fresh whip-crack and the gale-force winds threaten to toss any player—or announcer—right into the churning waves below! It’s Tuesday Night Trollball, and the atmosphere is positively electric with the promise of broken bones and shattered dreams! 🌊🏈\n\nTonight, we’ve got a real clash of cultures on the pitch! Our home team, The Southport Narwhals, are looking as salty and mean as a cornered sea-beast. I just saw Malcolm Goer performing his pre-game ritual, rubbing the trollball right under his armpits for that extra 'grip.' Disgusting? Absolutely! Effective? We’ll find out! Meanwhile, Cibis Areta just had a teammate dump a bucket of ice-cold seawater over her head. That’s the kind of grit I love to see, folks! They’re native Osterrans who know how to take a hit and give one back ten-fold! 🐳\n\nBut then... ugh, look at the visitors. The Haven Lights. 🙄 Coming all the way from their 'Hallowed Ground' in the Temple of Light. You can practically smell the incense and self-righteousness from here! They’ve got Shiroma Salim over there meticulously re-taping his shield with fresh leather, looking far too clean for my tastes. And would you believe it? Their healer, Riffle Harrington, is actually tying his bootlaces together and hopping to the starting line! It’s pathetic, really, but I suppose that’s what passes for 'divine inspiration' these days. I’m hoping the Narwhals knock those shiny teeth right down their throats! ☀️\n\nWhether you’re an adventurer pulled from another reality or a local just looking for some carnage, this is the place to be! Remember, in the Everwar, death is just a temporary setback, but the shame of a missed goal lasts until your next regeneration! So, keep your eyes on the field and your hands on your wallets, because the action is about to start, and it’s going to be a real humdinger! Let's get that troll head in the basket! 💀🔥",
    "postGame": "Sweet mother of mayhem, what a finish! I’m still scraping the salt and blood off my microphone! Nok the Corrupter here to tell you that if you missed tonight’s clash at the Cliffside Pitch, you missed a symphony of suffering! The Haven Lights—ugh, I can barely say it—managed to squeak out a victory over our Southport Narwhals with a final score of 3 to 2! It was a nail-biter that went all the way into Overtime, and while I hate to see those Temple-dwelling light-bringers win, the violence was truly top-shelf! 🥂🏟️\n\nThe action kicked off with a real bang in the second half! Braden Gaile snatched up the trollball in Center Field, but the Haven Lights weren't playing nice! Shiroma Salim—that shield-taping goody-two-shoes—delivered a tackle on Loralyn Lyndy that sounded like a dry branch snapping! Loralyn went down hard, INJURED and sent straight to the sidelines! You love to see it! But the Narwhals didn't stay down for long, oh no! 🦴💥\n\nNot to be outdone, Coward Tarton decided to show the home crowd what 'Haven hospitality' looks like by absolutely leveling Malcolm Goer! Another injury for the Narwhals! It was looking grim for the Southport crew, but Sand Denys, their healer, proved she’s worth her weight in gold, dragging Loralyn Lyndy back onto the field just in time for more punishment. That's the spirit of the Everwar—get up and get hit again! 🚑🔥\n\nThe middle of the game was a chaotic scramble! We saw missed shots from Fineman Dolhenty and Farand Keil that probably hit some poor seagulls in the upper atmosphere. The wind was howling, the ball was slick with sea spray, and players were dropping it like it was a hot coal! Marlane Lounge and Riffle Heyde couldn't seem to find their rhythm, fumbling passes that would make a goblin blush. It was a beautiful, disorganized mess! 🌊🥴\n\nJust when you thought the Narwhals were losing steam, Torey Dannye stepped up and absolutely CRUNCHED Coward Tarton! The Haven player was sent packing to the injury tent, much to my delight! I haven't seen a hit that satisfying since Sir Tanos tried to use a map! It sent the game spiraling into a deadlock as the clock ran out. That’s right, sports fans—OVERTIME! The most delicious words in the demonic language! 😈⏳\n\nIn the Overtime period, the tension was thicker than the fog rolling off the coast. Each team had their wounded patched up and sent back into the meat grinder. Blanc Fantasia scooped up the ball, but the defense was like a stone wall. Then, out of nowhere, Blood Eppes decided he’d had enough of Zwart Bunns' whispering to the ball and laid him out flat! Another Haven Light extinguished and sent to the healer! I was cheering so loud I nearly lost my horns! 📣👊\n\nBut then, the unthinkable happened. With the Narwhals' defense momentarily distracted by the carnage, the Haven Lights found an opening. Farand Keil and Coward Tarton—freshly returned to the field—orchestrated a desperate push toward the end zone. The Narwhals were scrambling, the sea spray was blinding, and the gale was at its peak! 🌬️🏃‍♂️\n\nIn the final, heart-wrenching play, Dickenson Beker found the opening she needed. She didn't just walk it in; she sprinted into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL! The lights went wild, the Narwhals fans went silent, and I nearly threw my headset into the ocean in frustration! A 3-2 victory for the away team. Truly a dark day for anyone who appreciates a good underdog story! 🏀😫\n\nI have to say, seeing the Haven Lights celebrate makes my skin crawl. They probably think this victory was 'divinely ordained' or some such nonsense. I bet Nikos Thanae is somewhere 'benevolently' nodding in approval, which is enough to make anyone want to jump off this cliff! Honestly, if these 'heroes' spent half as much time practicing their aim as they do polishing their armor, the game wouldn't have been this close! 🙄✨\n\nDespite the result, you can't deny the Narwhals put on a show! They fought like cornered rats and left plenty of bruises on those shining knights. To the Southport fans: drown your sorrows in some local ale tonight; you earned it! And to the Haven Lights: enjoy your win while it lasts, because the Ebon Gate Corruptors are watching, and we don't play as nice as the Narwhals do! 🍻🖤\n\nThat wraps it up for Tuesday Night Trollball! I’m Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the windiest place in Osterra. Remember, keep your weapons sharp, your healers busy, and always bet on the team that doesn't pray before the coin toss! Goodnight, and may your regenerations be swift and your enemies' bones be brittle! 🎙️👹👋",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL LIVE FROM THE STARLIGHT LAGOON! 🎙️\\n\\nGreetings, ghouls, ghosts, and glorious gladiators of Osterra! It is a marvelous Tuesday night for some Trollball! We’re coming to you live from the Prismatic Pavilion, perched precariously over the Starlight Lagoon, where the water is blue and the bruises are purple! Today’s matchup features the wealth-worshipping **New Prosperity Profits** visiting the chaotic carnival known as the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres**! I can smell the profit and the greasepaint from the announcer's booth!\\n\\nLook at those Profits preparing for the slaughter! **Boleslaw Heathcote** is currently inhaling the fumes of burning parchment—nothing like a little light arson to get the blood pumping! And there’s **Yoshi Cathy**, folks, devouring a raw onion like it’s a sweet summer peach. That’s the kind of intestinal fortitude that makes a demon weep with joy! They’re backed by the Guild of the Black Sky, and I’m sure that strangely beautiful kissless virgin Brennen Farno has a heavy wager on this one. If only he’d spend less time being a money priest and more time enjoying a good old-fashioned evisceration!\\n\\nBut don’t count out our hosts, the Bizarres! Kython’s crew is out in force today, and I see **Quintessa Austine** trying to get a slow clap going with an audience that’s more interested in the concessions than the combat! **Gagliano Tallbott** is currently telling a joke to the troll head—let's hope the ball finds it funny, or it might just slip right through his fingers! It’s going to be a real humdinger of a game, so grab your spiked refreshments and settle in for the violence! 🍿👹",
    "postGame": "### 🏟️ THE VERDICT IS IN: PROFIT MARGINS AND BROKEN BONES! 🏟️\\n\\nWhat a magnificent display of mayhem we’ve witnessed here at the Pavilion! The **New Prosperity Profits** have walked away with a hard-fought **1 to 0 victory** over the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres**! It was a defensive struggle for the ages, filled with more broken bones than a necromancer’s workshop! Truly a delight for the senses! 💀\\n\\nThe action started fast and furious in center field when **Yoshi Cathy** snatched up that beautiful leather head! But the Bizarres weren’t going to let the money-men walk all over them. We saw some spectacular blocking early on, with **Pulchi Benyamin** and **Pellikka Concettina** standing their ground like iron walls against the charging Gagliano Tallbott! Say, those Profits really know how to protect their assets!\\n\\nThe first real taste of Oesterran hospitality came when **Pulchi Benyamin** absolutely leveled **Milo Nelie**! It was a gorgeous tackle that sent Milo straight to the dirt! That’s what I call a blue-ribbon collision, folks! You could hear the ribs snapping from the top row of the velvet-lined boxes where the bankers sit! 🔨\\n\\nBut the Bizarres had some fight in them yet! **Gagliano Tallbott**, clearly not appreciating the 'joke' Pulchi played on his teammate, came back later and delivered a thumping tackle that left Pulchi seeing stars and singing soprano! It’s a good thing the Everwar keeps these folks coming back, because that was a hit that would’ve ended a career in any other reality! \\n\\nThe second half was just as delicious! **Aggri Cookie** decided **Gladdie Farika** had stayed in the game too long and sent them packing with a tackle that would make Geth the Gravelord crack a smile! It was pure, unadulterated Trollball poetry in motion, and the crowd roared for the blood on the planks! 🩸\\n\\nHowever, the turning point came when **Faina Hendrix** decided enough was enough! With the grace of a gazelle and the ferocity of a demon, Hendrix charged right into the End Zone and **DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL**! A one-point touchdown that felt like a ton of bricks falling on the Bizarres' hopes! What a play! Hendrix is a real crackerjack athlete! 🏀\\n\\nThe Bizarres tried to rally, with **Willa Lois** delivering a bone-crunching tackle to **Aufmann Tedric**, but the Profit's defense held firm. Even an interception by **Melesa Zelten** late in the game wasn't enough to turn the tide against the financial juggernaut of New Prosperity! I suppose even the Prismatic Troupe can't juggle their way out of a solid defense!\\n\\nI have to say, seeing **Merissa Mathian** and **Essa Pattie** working overtime to scrape their players off the stage-planks was a real treat! Those healers are the unsung heroes of the game, even if they are keeping the fun from being permanent! It’s a shame the 'heroes' of the realm aren't here to see what real work looks like! 💉\\n\\nIn the final moments, **Yoshi Cathy** reminded us why he’s a force to be reckoned with, taking out **Gagliano Tallbott** just for good measure! It’s that kind of spiteful, high-energy finish that keeps the fans coming back to the Starlight Lagoon week after week! Yoshi really finished that onion and finished the game!\\n\\nSo, as the sun sets over the pavilion, the New Prosperity Profits count their winnings and the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres lick their wounds! Another Tuesday night, another glorious chapter in the book of Trollball! I’m Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that life is short, but the Everwar is long, so hit 'em hard and hit 'em often! Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙🔥",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ STEP RIGHT UP, SPORTS FANS! IT'S TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! 🎙️\n\nHello, Osterra! This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live and loud from the sparkling—and frankly, nauseatingly clean—Buccaneer's Bowl on Toast Island! Oh, look at that pristine turf! It’s almost a shame we’re about to soak it in sweat and ichor, isn't it? Hahaha! My old pals Morgwae and Artorias really did me a favor letting me out of that gloomy Demon Prison; who knew the fresh air of a resort could smell so much like impending violence? \n\nTonight, we have a real humdinger of a match-up! The **Zmeigorod Snessengers** have slithered out of the swamp to face off against the **The Tortell Privateers**! It’s a clash of cultures, folks! On one side, we’ve got the Snessengers, led by Waldon Tadeo who is currently—I kid you not—rubbing a foul-smelling mushroom on their elbows. Whatever works for flexibility, right? Over in the Privateers' dugout, Dib Tufts is chugging a raw egg, shell and all! That’s the kind of grit that makes this game the greatest spectacle in the Everwar! 🥚💥\n\nBut hold onto your hats, because tonight is an **OPEN BAR** night! 🍻 That’s right, the booze is flowing faster than the blood! I see Elspeth Ortell over there, probably brewing up some of her famous ritual sangria to keep the 'festivities' going. Even that literacy-spreading pest Cinnemon is here, though I hope someone tackles him into the puppet kraken! We’re expecting hits so hard they’ll knock the memories right out of these adventurers before they even hit the regeneration cycle! Let’s get ready for some TROLLBALL! ⚾👹",
    "postGame": "### 🏟️ THE DUST SETTLES ON TOAST ISLAND: A BOOZY BLOODBATH! 🏟️\n\nGreat ghouls and ghosts, what a spectacle! The Zmeigorod Snessengers have absolutely dismantled the Tortell Privateers with a final score of **5 to 1**! It wasn't just a game; it was a drunken demolition derby! I haven't seen this much stumbling since Sir Tanos tried to read a map! Hahaha! The Privateers might have the fancy resort and the pristine turf, but the Snessengers brought the swamp-bred savagery and a much higher tolerance for the open bar! 🐍🔥\n\nThe carnage started early when Arni Griffith snagged the ball in Center Field, but the Privateers weren't playing nice. Kidder Starkey absolutely leveled Delija Dowling, sending him to the healer before the first whistle had even cooled! But the Snessengers wouldn't be denied. Kleinstein MacGregor—after clapping a prime number of times, mind you—unleashed a thunderous shot from Home Field to put Zmeigorod on the board! The crowd went wild, and the players went straight for the kegs! 🍺💨\n\nAs the alcohol started to kick in, the plays got... well, let's call them 'creative.' Payson Jan was a one-man wrecking crew, injuring both Kleinstein MacGregor and Rose Kluge in rapid succession! But Arni Griffith, despite being three sheets to the wind, managed to sink another beautiful shot from Home Field! By the time halftime rolled around, half the field was seeing double, and I’m pretty sure I saw Evalyn Pierrepont trying to polish his helmet with a snail that had already passed out from the fumes! 🐌🥴\n\nThe second half was pure, unadulterated chaos. Castorina Gies gave the home crowd something to cheer about, drunkenly stumbling into the End Zone for the Privateers' lone goal! It was a beautiful, wobbling display of athleticism that surely made Elspeth Ortell proud. But the Snessengers' Dare Wynnie answered back with a dunk that was so forceful, I think the puppet kraken in the bay actually flinched! Zmeigorod was simply too much for the resort-dwellers to handle. 🦑🏀\n\nSpeaking of the Privateers, their coordination fell apart faster than a peace treaty signed by Sir Randy. Lilithe Royce intercepted a wild pass from Delija Dowling, only to have the ball dropped moments later by a very intoxicated Ellan Elburt. It was like watching a group of newborn fawns trying to play rugby in a brewery! Even the 'heroes' in the stands looked embarrassed. I saw Imra, the Master of Elixirs, taking notes—probably on how NOT to mix sports and spirits! 🧪🍷\n\nThe injuries continued to pile up like bodies in a Geth funeral pyre. Loralee Sunny sent Arni Griffith to the sidelines with a brutal tackle, but it was too little, too late. The Snessengers' defense, though swaying slightly, held firm. Avaria Revell and Evalyn Pierrepont were throwing passes that looked more like desperate heaves, yet they kept the pressure on. The Privateers' luck had simply run dry, much like the first three kegs at the sideline bar! 💀🍻\n\nIn a hilarious turn of events, Gere Cordelie spent most of the fourth quarter stumbling around 'DRUNK' according to my charts, yet still managed to lead the charge! The Snessengers' Dare Wynnie put the final nail in the coffin with another spectacular dunk in the End Zone. By that point, Payson Jan was literally stumbling around the field, probably looking for a place to nap rather than a ball to tackle. It was a glorious, messy, wonderful disaster! 🎊🤕\n\nYou have to love the irony, folks! The Privateers, backed by the wealthy interests of Cedar Hill, couldn't buy a win against the swamp-dwellers. Maybe they should spend less time on 'secret hand signals' and more time practicing how to walk in a straight line after four ales! I bet Sir Artorias is somewhere 'Moonslaying' his way through a bottle of wine just to forget this performance. At least Eugen Zacks stayed busy at the healer's tent; that man earns every copper! 💰🩹\n\nSo, there you have it! The Zmeigorod Snessengers take home the glory, the points, and probably most of the remaining booze! They showed us that a little mushroom on the elbows and a heroic backstory for a troll head goes a long way. The Tortell Privateers? Well, they'll have plenty of time to nurse their hangovers and their bruised egos on the beach tomorrow. Just watch out for the resort security, boys! 🏝️🤮\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the Buccaneer's Bowl! What a night for Trollball! We had goals, we had gore, and we had a record-breaking amount of liver damage! Join us next week for more Tuesday Night Trollball, where the hits are hard, the heroes are mocked, and the action never stays dead! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🎙️👹🤘",

    "preGame": "# 🎙️ LIVE FROM THE HOLLOW MINE: TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! 🎙️ ⚾️ Well hello there, sports fans! This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the wildflower-covered base of the Watch Tower! Can you feel that energy? The ground is literally humming, or maybe that's just the anticipation of seeing some skulls cracked for your Tuesday evening entertainment! We’ve got a real peach of a matchup tonight as the Kerlauger Runeguard travel from their crumbling ruins to face our hosts, the Wyrmwood Stronghammers! 💥 ⚾️ Now look at these Stronghammers, folks! These boys and ghouls are emerging from a mine shaft like it's a grand opening of a fresh grave! I saw Ultun Barthelemy in the tunnel earlier, diligently braiding a teammate's nose hair—now that is the kind of focus that wins championships! And keep an eye on Calvinna Isador; she’s currently giving a speech so nonsensical it makes Sir Randy's tactical advice look like high philosophy! It’s absolute madness, and I love every second of it! 🍖 ⚾️ But don't count out the Kerlauger Runeguard! They might be associated with those stuffy White Ravens, but they play like they’ve got something to prove! Eal Caundra is over there reciting the names of legends—boring!—but Vivia Namara just spat in her own hand and slapped herself across the face! Now that’s a pre-game ritual I can get behind! It’s almost as good as the rituals we see with the Ebon Gate Corruptors, who truly know how to treat a Trollhead with respect! Unlike those Haven Lights, who probably wash their hands after every tackle! Let’s get to the carnage! 🦴",
    "postGame": "# 🏟️ FINAL SCORE: STRONGHAMMERS SMASH THE RUNEGUARD! 🏟️ ⚾️ What a humdinger of a match we witnessed tonight, folks! It was a real seesaw of violence that would make even my old boss Orzalon crack a smile from his prison cell! The action started fast and furious in Center Field when Gurney Fadiman scooped up the head, but Ultun Barthelemy wasn't having any of that! Ultun came in with a tackle so crisp it sent Gurney straight to the healer’s tent! Ha-ha! That’s the kind of Tuesday night I live for! 💥 ⚾️ The Runeguard tried to fight back, and let me tell you, Lon Gabriell was a one-woman wrecking crew! She wasn't just blocking; she was hunting! She took Ultun Barthelemy right out of the game with a tackle that sounded like a dry branch snapping! Not content with just one scalp, she later leveled Calvinna Isador! If the rest of the Runeguard had half her fire, they wouldn’t be looking at a goose egg on the scoreboard right now! 🥊 ⚾️ We saw a bit of high-flying desperation when Benjie Foulk tried to air it out, but Odelia Abbott was there to play spoiler! Odelia snatched that pass right out of the air like a hawk grabbing a field mouse! It was a beautiful interception, though I must say, the 'heroes' of the realm like Sir Tanos usually need a cursed sword to be that effective. Odelia just did it with grit and a whip in hand! 🦅 ⚾️ By the time halftime rolled around, the ground was soaked with more than just that strange 'humming energy.' Both teams took a breather to let the regeneration kick in. It’s a miracle of Osterra, isn't it? One minute you’re a pile of broken bones, the next you’re back on the field ready for more! It’s certainly more efficient than waiting for Imra to mix up a dusty elixir! 🧪 ⚾️ The second half saw the Wyrmwood Stronghammers really turn up the heat. Cornela Piscatelli—who, mind you, spent his pre-game braiding nose hairs—decided to start braiding ribs instead! He absolutely leveled Reginauld Cordell, leaving him for the healers to sort out! It was a textbook hit, the kind we usually see from the Ebon Gate Corruptors on a Saturday night! 💥 ⚾️ Then came the breakthrough! Autumn Jodoin, after chugging enough raw eggs to make a dragon gag, found a seam in the defense! With the ball tucked tight, Autumn sprinted through the Away 2-Point zone and slammed that troll head right into the goal! Dunk! The crowd went wild, and the Stronghammers took a 1-0 lead! It was poetry in motion, if poetry involved heavy armor and sweat! 📝 ⚾️ The Runeguard tried to mount a comeback, with Gurney Fadiman returning to the field and immediately taking his frustrations out on Godart Urissa! Godart went down hard, but the Stronghammers are made of sterner stuff! They didn't let the injury slow them down for a second! They’re probably used to it, living so close to that merchant prince Trez Arrigo; you have to be tough to survive that much 'commerce'! 💰 ⚾️ Rebane Kendy, the man who loves a good earlobe tug, decided he wanted a piece of the glory too! While Lorilee Aldred was busy flattening Cornela Piscatelli in a fit of rage, Kendy found the opening! He danced through the defense and delivered a second dunk right into the basket! 2-0, Stronghammers! The Kerlauger defense looked like it was standing in dense fog even though the sun was still up! 🌫️ ⚾️ As the final whistle blew, the Kerlauger Runeguard were left scratching their heads and licking their wounds. Lorilee Aldred got one last tackle in on Cornela, but it was far too little, far too late! The Stronghammers defended their Hollow Mine with the kind of ferocity that would make a Bog Queen proud! 🏰 ⚾️ So there you have it, folks! A 2-0 victory for the Wyrmwood Stronghammers! They played with heart, they played with steel, and most importantly, they played with a complete disregard for their opponents' well-being! Kerlauger is going back to their ruins with nothing but bruises and memories of a sound beating! 📉 ⚾️ This is Nok the Corrupter signing off! Remember, life is short, the Everwar is long, and Trollball is the only thing that makes the regeneration worth it! Stay brutal, Osterra! And if you see Sir Artorias, tell him he still owes me a souvenir from the Fey realm! Goodnight, everyone! 🎙️🌑",
