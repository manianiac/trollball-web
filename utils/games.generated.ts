We are coming to you live from the Su'akour Bowl for a Tuesday night clash that promises to be more bone-crunching than a meeting with Cyfnerth the Butcher! I'm Nok the Corrupter, your favorite demon of the airwaves, and I am absolutely electrified for tonight's matchup between the Confluence Captains and the home-team Brimstone Fire Eaters! The Captains are looking focused, with Ladew Evelina already chugging raw eggs, shells and all, while Kant Langill is 'loosening the joints' with a dance that looks more like a seizure—it is simply marvelous! 🥚💃 Over in the home dugout, the Fire Eaters are embracing the grit of the ruins! Campball Fink is bare-foot in a mud puddle as we speak, and Bollinger Susette is getting his shoulders tenderized with a teammate’s fists! With the crumbling walls of this fortress threatening to drop a stone on anyone who stands still too long, we are in for a real treat! The Guild's boys might have the fancy gear, but the Fire Eaters have the fumes! Let us see if the Captains can navigate the uneven ground or if they will end up as part of the ruins themselves! It is Trollball time, and I could not be happier! 😈🏈",
    "postGame": "What a spectacular display of athletic carnage! The Brimstone Fire Eaters have emerged victorious in an overtime nail-biter, defeating the Confluence Captains with a final score of 3 to 2! The Su'akour Bowl lived up to its reputation, with the noxious fumes and crumbling walls providing a perfectly hazardous backdrop for this beautiful game! 🏟️🔥 The action started fast and heavy when Nigel Rothmuller decided he did not like the look of Carnahan Laud’s face, tackling her so hard she had to be carried off the field! It was a masterpiece of physical persuasion that set the tone for the entire match! 👊 Shortly after, Selimah Tully joined the fun by sending Caves Cestar to the dirt with an injury that would make even the stoic Sir Tanos wince! 🦴 The Fire Eaters drew first blood on the scoreboard when Campball Fink charged into the end zone for a magnificent dunk! The home crowd went wild, though that might have been the sulfur gas talking! 👃 But those Captains from the Guild of the Black Sky showed they have more than just deep pockets! Ladew Evelina, fueled by that raw egg she ate earlier, pulled off a staggering two-point shot from the home field! It was a display of accuracy that Chairman Garon Ironrock would probably try to tax if he could! 🎯 As the game went into overtime, the violence only escalated! Caves Cestar returned to the field with a grudge, immediately taking out Orlina Jerrine and Nigel Rothmuller in a flurry of revenge! It was like watching a beautiful, bloody ballet in the mud! 🩰 Healer Raphael Miyasawa was working at a fever pitch, dragging players back from the brink of the void just to throw them back into the meat grinder! That is the spirit of the Everwar we love to see! 💉 Even when Carnahan Laud managed to retaliate and take out the scoring threat of Campball Fink, the Fire Eaters refused to buckle under the pressure! The uneven ground of the stadium seemed to favor the home team as the Captains struggled to maintain their footing! 🏔️ The climax of this glorious struggle came when Oona Jane delivered a pass that was smoother than a lie from a Fey hater! She found Bollinger Susette in the end zone, who slammed the troll head home for the winning dunk! 🏆 What a day for Brimstone! It is a shame the Haven Lights were not here to see it; they probably would have spent the whole time crying about the 'sanctity of life'! 🕯️ This is the kind of grit that keeps Osterra spinning! To the Confluence Captains, better luck next time—maybe try rubbing more sap on your arms! To the Fire Eaters, enjoy your victory in the ruins! This is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that if you are not bleeding, you are not playing! Goodnight, you beautiful monsters! 😈🎙️",

    "preGame": "# 🎙️ LIVE FROM THE SUN-BAKED BOWL! 🎙️  Hello, hello, hello, you beautiful bags of meat and misery! It is your favorite voice from the abyss, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live for a Week 7 Tuesday Night Trollball spectacular! We are huddled deep in the Great Desert at the Sun-Baked Bowl, where the heat is high, the stakes are higher, and the sand is just waiting to turn every open wound into a gritty mess! We have got a real treat today as the Warden-backed Oak & Onslaught travel into the dunes to face off against the Desert Spectres, and let me tell you, the atmosphere is absolutely electric! I see Steve over there with the Spectres already organizing a betting pool on the first casualty—that is the spirit, kid!  Speaking of spirit, the ale is flowing like the River Styx because tonight is an OPEN BAR match! Oh, I can already hear the liver-failure from here! Look at those Oak & Onslaught ruffians getting ready. Wynnie Faina has his boots on the wrong feet again—is it luck or just the pre-game jitters? And Milt Casady is leading that synchronized chant that’s getting louder and louder, enough to wake the dead! Meanwhile, over in the Spectres’ dugout, Fidellia Mozelle is sniffing a piece of burnt wood like it’s a fine bouquet of roses. I love the smell of charcoal in the morning!  Now, while I’d much rather be watching my beloved Ebon Gate Corruptors tear the wings off some angels, these two teams will have to do! Better them than those insufferable, shiny-armored Haven Lights, am I right? I swear, if I have to see one more 'heroic' speech from a Light, I’ll vomit a swarm of locusts. Today, it’s all about the grit, the sweat, and the Wardens trying to prove they aren’t just glorified park rangers. Let’s get to the action!",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 OAK & ONSLAUGHT LEAVE THE SPECTRES IN THE DUST! 🏆  What a game, folks! What a beautiful, drunken, blood-soaked disaster! Final score: Oak & Onslaught 5, Desert Spectres 2! It was a real humdinger of a match where the booze was plentiful and the coordination was... well, let's just say the ground got tackled more than the players! The Wardens’ own Oak & Onslaught took home the victory, proving that even with boots on the wrong feet, they can still navigate a desert better than the locals!  The action started hot and fast, just the way I like it! Ema Ulrick snatched up that troll head in the center field, but it was Symer Crissy who stole the show early on! Crissy launched two beautiful shots from the center field, finding the basket and sending the crowd into a frenzy! Every time that leather head hit the net, the open bar worked overtime, and let me tell you, the players started feeling it! Heyes Iver and Abner Seidel were looking tipsy before the first quarter was even over!  Then came Millham Evangeline, who apparently thrives on a little liquid courage! Evangeline hammered home two more scores from center field, making it look easy while the Spectres were still trying to figure out which way the basket was facing. The violence was top-shelf, too! Wynnie Faina, despite the boot situation, managed to tipsily tackle Huesman Ring right into the infirmary! It was a glorious sight to see Huesman Ring get absolutely leveled not once, but twice!  But wait, the highlight of the half had to be Hole Bowerman! This Warden warrior was stumbling around in a drunken stupor but somehow found the end zone twice! Bowerman literally dunked the ball into the goal, probably thinking it was a giant mug of ale! At that point, the Spectres were so deep in the cups that Shelman McQuoid was just wandering around aimlessly. I haven’t seen a man that lost since Sir Randy tried to find his way out of a paper bag!  The Spectres didn't go down without a fight, though. Lovash Marius decided to show some spine in the second half, despite the intense heat and the dehydration! Marius launched two desperate, drunken shots from the away field that actually found their mark! It was a valiant effort for a team that looked like they were trying to play underwater. Geth the Gravelord is going to be disappointed in his Spectres tonight, but hey, at least they’ll have a hell of a hangover to remember it by!  Speaking of hangovers, Muscolo Jaehne was absolutely plastered! Jaehne managed to tackle Affra Yanaton into an injury, which was a nice touch of brutality amidst the fumbling. We saw interceptions, we saw wild passes that hit the dirt, and we saw more stumbling than a newborn fawn on ice! Teria Ravo was out there shooting wild, and the ball was changing hands like a hot potato at a demon's picnic!  The stadium was a character all its own today! That Sun-Baked Bowl really took its toll. You could see the players wilting under the oppressive heat, their armor probably acting like a portable oven. I saw Eileen Mikihisa trying to tackle Crissy and missing by a country mile—I blame the sand in his eyes and the gin in his belly! It’s a miracle anyone stayed upright long enough to score!  And let's talk about the 'heroes' of the realm! If Sir Artorias or that warlock Morgwae had been out there, they probably would have spent the whole game trying to 'save' the Trollball instead of throwing it! Give me a break! These players showed more heart (and liver capacity) than those fancy adventurers ever could. I’m just glad we didn’t have to deal with any fey nonsense today; just good, old-fashioned desert brawling!  As the final whistle blew, Oak & Onslaught stood tall at 5-2. The Wardens will be celebrating tonight, probably by headbutting trees or whatever it is they do for fun. The Spectres, meanwhile, are likely passed out in the dunes. I hope someone remembers to fetch them before the sandstorms move in, or we’ll have a few more spectres to add to the team roster next week!  What a hoot! What a holler! Trollball at its finest, folks! The brutality was high, the skill was questionable, and the alcohol content was through the roof! I’m Nok the Corrupter, wishing you all a night of terrible dreams and even worse hangovers! See you next Tuesday for more Trollball mayhem! Stay corrupted, Osterra!",

    "preGame": "# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL PRE-GAME REPORT: BATTLE AT THE BASTION! 🏟️ Hello, hello, hello, fans and fiends! This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the misty, jagged heights of **The Old Fort**! We've got a humdinger of a matchup tonight as the flashy **Tortell Privateers** sail inland to face the grim defenders of the **Kerlauger Runeguard**! The fog is so thick you could carve it with a war-scythe, and the footing is about as stable as a goblin on a grease-slide! 🌫️ Speaking of the Privateers, I saw **Keisling Damalas** earlier, and boy, he’s really leaning into the aesthetic, painting those teeth pitch-black with charcoal! It’s a terrifying sight, almost as scary as **Lilithe Royce** letting those leeches have a go at her legs to 'lighten the step.' Talk about dedication to the craft! 🩸 On the home side, the Runeguard are looking stoic as ever among these ancient runes. **Gurney Fadiman** just led a toast of goat’s milk—disgusting stuff, really, give me a flagon of soul-rot any day—but it’s clear they’re ready to defend this pile of rocks! 🐐 The crowd is buzzing, despite the 'White Ravens' looming around like a bad omen. Will the Privateers find the gold, or will the Runeguard leave them buried in the dirt? Stay tuned, because the violence is about to begin! 💥",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 POST-GAME WRAP-UP: PRIVATEERS PLUNDER THE FORT! 🏆 What a magnificent display of carnage! Your old pal Nok has never seen such a beautiful mess of broken armor and shattered dreams! The **Tortell Privateers** have pulled off a narrow victory, edging out the **Kerlauger Runeguard** with a final score of **5 to 4**! 🏴‍☠️ The game started with a bang—literally! **Reginauld Cordell** snatched up the ball in the fog, but the highlight of the early half was **Johnna Beetner**, who cut through the defense like a hot knife through butter and dunked that troll head straight into the basket for the first score! 🏀 The violence was top-shelf tonight, folks! **Vivia Namara** was a one-woman wrecking crew, absolutely demolishing **Castorina Gies** and later **Goldberg Tova** with tackles that echoed through the ruins! I haven't seen that much flying dirt since Dame Terra Monteforte's last temper tantrum! 🧱 The Runeguard held a lead for a while, especially after **Shepperd Trefler** sent a beautiful shot sailing from the Away Field into the goal for two big points! It looked like the home crowd was going to have something to cheer about besides old rocks! 🎯 But the Privateers aren't just about flashy capes and charcoal teeth! After **Eugen Zacks** worked some medical magic to get the injured back on the field, the comeback was on! **Melisande Eustacia** found the End Zone for a gritty dunk that turned the tide! 🌊 The real star of the evening, however, was **Loralee Sunny**! While the defense was busy trying to find their feet in the uneven ruins, Sunny was a bolt of lightning, scoring twice from distance to push the Privateers over the edge! ⚡️ I have to give a shout-out to the brutality in the mud—**Reginauld Cordell** absolutely flattened **Kidder Starkey**, and **Lon Gabriell** sent **Loralee Sunny** to the sidelines briefly with a tackle that would have made an ogre blush! It’s that kind of grit that makes Trollball the only sport worth watching in this respawning reality! 💀 Speaking of 'heroes,' I didn't see much help coming from those White Ravens today. **Colm** might have a cursed handshake, but it didn't help the Runeguard keep hold of the ball! Perhaps they should spend less time reciting legendary names and more time practicing their aim! 🐦 The fans are heading home, some of them probably lost in the fog, but the Tortell Privateers are leaving with the win and a lot of bruised egos left in their wake! It wasn't quite a victory for my beloved **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, but seeing the Runeguard fall in their own fort is the next best thing! 🏁 This is Nok the Corrupter signing off! Remember, if you aren't bleeding, you aren't playing! Goodnight, Osterra! 🎙️🔥",

    "preGame": "Step right up and tune those dials, sports fans! This is Nok the Corrupter, your favorite demon of the airwaves, coming to you live from the magnificent Stronghold Bailey! 🎙️ Today, the New Ravenfall Commanders are hosting those shiny, self-righteous goody-two-shoes from Haven, the Haven Lights! The atmosphere here in the bailey is absolutely electric—or maybe that's just the smell of ozone and damp cobblestone! The Rampart Shadows are stretching long across the pitch, and the Castle Echo is making every clank of armor sound like a symphony of destruction! 🏰 It’s a packed house today; the local Commanders have the crowd in a tizzy while the Haven fans seem to be too busy praying to notice the impending carnage! 🛡️ Look at the sidelines, folks! Shiroma Salim is meticulously re-taping that Kirkhammer handle, looking for that perfect grip to crack some skulls! Meanwhile, over in the Commanders' camp, Jozef Pepe is currently winning the team belching contest—now that’s what I call a pre-game ritual! Rhett Gavrilla is busy hunting for pebbles to add to their collection, and young Tybi Reo of the Lights is drawing a troll head that looks more like a lumpy potato! 🥔 The Haven Lights are trying to stay humble, but we all know they're just waiting to use those maces for 'peaceful' purposes. Will the 'Lights' be extinguished under the weight of the Stronghold, or will the Commanders find themselves echoing in the halls of defeat? Grab your snacks and hide your souls, because Tuesday Night Trollball is about to begin! 👹🏈",
    "postGame": "Holy Moly, what a bone-rattling display of athleticism and pure, unadulterated violence we just witnessed here at the Stronghold Bailey! 🦴 The New Ravenfall Commanders have defended their home turf with a final score of 2 to 1, leaving the Haven Lights flickering in the wind! The game started with a flurry of action as Croteau Osmo snatched the ball right out of the gate, but the 'peaceful' Haven Lights showed their true colors early. Riffle Heyde absolutely leveled Jozef Pepe, sending him straight to the infirmary before the first whistle had even cooled! 🤕 The violence didn't stop there, folks! Wieren Ivar, that brute from Haven, decided Croteau Osmo’s ribs were better off in pieces, knocking the ball loose with a sickening crunch! The Commanders tried to gain ground, but Estes Adrian threw a pass so wild it practically begged Farand Keil to intercept it! It was a comedy of errors until Marlane Lounge decided to play judge, jury, and executioner, flattening Jessalin Zobias into the dirt! 🏛️ Riffle Heyde was a one-demon wrecking crew today, later taking out both Dusa Curson and Theis Loredo with tackles that would make even my boss, Lord Orzalon, crack a smile in his cell! At halftime, the field looked more like a butcher's shop than a stadium, but thanks to the Everwar, everyone was back for more punishment in the second half! 🩸 The scoring finally opened up when Riffle Heyde found Wieren Ivar in the End Zone for a spectacular dunk, putting the Lights up by one! The Haven fans were cheering like they’d just seen a miracle, but their joy was short-lived! 🕯️ The Commanders roared back when Croteau Osmo, returning from their earlier injury, took a shot from way back in Center Field! The ball sailed through the goal for a massive 2-point score, flipping the game on its head and sending the rampart crowd into a literal frenzy! 🎯 The desperation of the Lights was palpable as they tried to respond. Zwart Bunns and Riffle Heyde had hands like butter, dropping passes left and right while the Commanders' defense turned into a brick wall. Jozef Pepe got his revenge by sending Zwart Bunns to the dirt, and Estes Adrian finished the job by taking Farand Keil out of the game entirely! 🔨 Even with the Lights' healer, Riffle Harrington, hopping around on tied-together bootlaces to bring players back, they couldn't overcome the Commanders' momentum. Those 'heroes' from Eponore like Sir Tanos and the God King Artorias must be beaming with pride at such a display of grit, though I'm sure they'd prefer if someone got stabbed with the Sunbringer instead! ☀️ In the end, the Haven Lights were simply outmatched by the cobblestone and the sheer aggression of New Ravenfall. It just goes to show you—you can tie your laces and whisper to the ball all you want, but at the end of the day, it's the one who hits hardest who takes the trophy! 🏆 What a glorious night for Trollball! This is Nok the Corrupter signing off, reminding you that there’s no 'I' in 'Team,' but there is definitely a 'U' in 'Unconscious!' Goodnight, Osterra! 🌙👹",

    "preGame": "# 🏟️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL: FROSTBITE AND FISTFIGHTS! 🏟️\n\nHello out there in radioland! This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you live from the edge of the world! We are hunkered down inside the **South Pole Palisade**, and let me tell you, folks, it is a real ice-box out here! The wind is howling like a pack of starving wolves—mostly because there *is* a pack of starving wolves howling right outside the log walls! Ha ha! \n\nTonight, we’ve got a real doozy for you. The **South Pole Yetis** are defending their home turf of frozen mud and straw against the visiting **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**! Now, the Chaos Creatures might be associated with that dirt-wizard Dame Terra Monteforte, but don’t let their lack of popular support fool you—these folks are ready to rumble! I saw **Lian Denton** earlier drinking a shot of hot gravy from a dented tin cup! That’s the kind of pre-game fuel that leads to broken ribs, and you know I love to see it! 🍵💥\n\nOn the other side of the field, the Yetis are looking chilly but lethal. **Udela Dorkus** was spotted licking a whetstone to sharpen her appetite for destruction, while **Seiter Aida** was getting a good whiff of some game-worn socks. It’s that kind of rustic charm that really brings the fans out—well, the five or six fans who weren't eaten by the local wildlife on the way here! It’s a shame the **Haven Lights** aren't here to get their teeth kicked in, but we'll make do with these scrappy underdogs! Let’s get to the action! ❄️🦴",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 POST-GAME WRAP-UP: A CHILLING VICTORY! 🏆\n\n## 🧊 Final Score: South Pole Yetis 1 - Chaos Creatures 0 🧊\n\nHoly smokes, what a game! If you like your sports cold, muddy, and full of medical emergencies, tonight was your Christmas, Hanukkah, and Solstice all rolled into one! The South Pole Yetis have defended their stockade in a game that was as tight as Sir Tanos's armor after a week of feasting! 🍗🛡️\n\nThings started off with a frantic scramble in center field! **Ajit Serge** scooped up that troll head like it was the last scrap of meat in a famine. The Chaos Creatures tried to put the squeeze on early, with **Mouldon Earl** showing some impressive blocking skills against Udela Dorkus. It was a real tug-of-war in the mud, folks, and the violence was just getting warmed up! 💥\n\nWe saw our first trip to the infirmary when **Fogel Raynold** absolutely leveled **Selima Si**! A beautiful tackle that sent Selima straight to the sidelines with an injury. That’s what we call a 'South Pole Stinger'! But don't you worry about the 'heroes' of the realm—even with Imra and Elspeth lurking around the Yetis' locker room, the brutality kept on coming! 🤕\n\nThe Chaos Creatures had their chances, believe you me! **Raouf Dragone** was charging toward the goal like a bat out of the Demon Prison, but the Yetis' defense held firm. **Sale Tocci** had a bit of a butter-fingers moment, dropping a pass to Coussoule Bidle that could have changed the whole complexion of the first half. It was enough to make a demon weep with joy at the incompetence! 🐉❌\n\nJust before the half-time whistle, the Yetis started playing dirty! **Sale Tocci** redeemed herself by injuring **Alben Diantha**, and then **Udela Dorkus** decided to send **Mouldon Earl** to the healer with a bone-crunching tackle! The Chaos Creatures were looking more like 'Chaos Crumbs' at that point! 🍞🦴\n\nAfter the break—where I assume everyone just huddled for warmth and prayed to whatever gods haven't abandoned Osterra—the blood started flowing again. **Raouf Dragone** came back with a vengeance, taking out **Sale Tocci**! It was a regular revolving door at the healer’s tent! **Seiter Aida** was working overtime to get those Yetis back on the field. ⛺🩹\n\n**Fogel Raynold** was a one-man wrecking crew tonight, folks! He sent **Isborne Krause** to the dirt with another injury. Honestly, if Fogel played for my **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, we’d have the league trophy by now! He was hitting harder than a hangover after an open bar at the Starlight Bazaar! 🔨💥\n\nWe had some missed opportunities that would make a ghost blush! Both **Udela Dorkus** and **Raouf Dragone** tried to play hero with long-distance shots from center field, but they both missed the basket! It’s harder to aim when your fingers are turning blue and the wind is whistling through the log walls, isn’t it? 🌬️🏀\n\nAs the clock ticked down, the tension was higher than High Prince Duke Barőn's wig! **Gabriele Klehm** managed to take out **Udela Dorkus** with a nasty tackle, but it was too little, too late for the New Monteforte squad. They just couldn't find the rhythm, probably because they were too busy listening to **Wolbrom Ariella** sing sea shanties out of tune! 🎶⚓\n\nThen came the play of the game! **Duky Orelee** grabbed the ball, dodged a few desperate swings, and charged into the End Zone like a man possessed! He **DUNKED** that troll head right into the basket! The crowd—mostly just a few frostbitten locals and some confused White Ravens—went wild! Or at least, they stomped their boots loudly! 🏀🔥\n\nAnd that’s all she wrote, folks! A 1-0 victory for the **South Pole Yetis**! They might not have the massive following of the **Zmeigorod Snessengers**, but they’ve got grit, they’ve got clubs, and they’ve got a stadium that smells like wet dog and bacon grease! The Chaos Creatures head back to New Monteforte with nothing but bruises and a cold. This is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off and heading to the nearest fire! Stay brutal, Osterra! 🏁👹",

    "preGame": "Greetings and salutations, sports fans! This is your favorite demon-about-town, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the precipice of peril! We are perched high atop The Cliffside Pitch in Southport, where the winds are howling like a banshee in a library and the sea spray is giving everyone a free salt-scrub! Boy howdy, you can feel the electricity in the air, or maybe that’s just the Gale-Force Winds threatening to toss our players right into the drink! 🌊🌪️\n\nTonight’s matchup is a real doozy, folks! We’ve got The Oread's Summit Tamers traveling down from their mountain fortress to take on The Southport Narwhals! I see Odericus Juxon over on the Tamers’ sideline, and she is absolutely going to town on her own helmet—slapping it until her ears ring! That’s the kind of dedication to brain-rattling action I love to see! On the other side, Malcolm Goer for the Narwhals is... well, he’s rubbing the Trollball in his armpits for 'extra grip.' It’s a bold strategy, Cotton, let’s see if the stench pays off! 👃🏈\n\nBut the real headline tonight, my friends, is the OPEN BAR! That’s right, the taps are flowing, the grog is golden, and the players are encouraged to hydrate with the hard stuff! I expect to see some truly imaginative violence once the spirits start kicking in. King Nezmear might be used to breeding werewolves in the north, but even his hounds couldn't handle the bite of this Southport moonshine! Don't expect any of those high-and-mighty 'heroes' like Sir Artorias to show up for this one—they're probably too busy polishing their medals to enjoy a good old-fashioned tavern-brawl on grass. Let’s get ready for some carnage! 🍻💀",
    "postGame": "Holy smoke, what a booze-fueled ballet of brutality we just witnessed! The Oread's Summit Tamers didn't just win; they absolutely decimated the Southport Narwhals with a final score of 5 to zip! It was a whitewash, a landslide, and a tavern-clearer all rolled into one! The Tamers showed up with a thirst for blood and a liver made of iron, leaving the Narwhals gasping in the sea spray! 🏔️🧤\n\nThe action started fast and furious when Edme Virgil snatched up that leather troll head right in Center Field! It wasn't long before Clippard Burr decided the goal was too far to walk to, so she just launched a shot from mid-field and—SWISH—right into the basket! Burr wasn't done, though; after a round of victory drinks, she did it again! Two points on the board before the Narwhals could even finish their first pint! 🎯🍺\n\nThen things got real messy, just the way I like it! Dric Trilley showed off some incredible footwork, dancing through the defense and DUNKED that troll head right into the goal! The alcohol was flowing like the Styx at a summer festival, and the hits started getting heavier. Edme Virgil—bless their wicked heart—absolutely leveled Cibis Areta, sending the Narwhal to the infirmary early. I haven't seen a hit that crisp since Sir Tanos tried to stab me in the Demon Prison! 💥👊\n\nBy the time we hit the second half, the 'Open Bar' was taking its toll. We had players 'tipsily' running, 'tipsily' tackling, and eventually, just 'DRUNKENLY' flailing about! Malcolm Goer and Alwyn Wandy were stumbling around like they were trying to walk on a deck in a hurricane! Alwyn Wandy even tried a drunken shot that missed so wide it nearly hit a seagull in the next county! It was pure, unadulterated comedy, folks! 🥴🐦\n\nThe carnage continued as Zadoc Wyatan and Clippard Burr took turns sending the Narwhals to see Sand Denys the Healer. Poor Fineman Dolhenty spent more time on the healer's bench than on the pitch! Even the 'heroes' of the realm couldn't have saved the Narwhals today. I bet King Nezmear is up in his tower, crying into his mead while Elizabeef the werecow looks on in disappointment. 🐄💧\n\nSaloma Talich decided to put the final nails in the coffin, firing off two more spectacular shots from Center Field while everyone else was too busy seeing double! The Narwhals tried to mount a comeback, with Blood Eppes attempting a drunken shot that went nowhere fast, but the Tamers' defense was like a mountain wall—mostly because they were probably leaning on each other to stay upright! 🏔️🛡️\n\nI must say, even though my heart belongs to the Ebon Gate Corruptors, you have to admire the sheer grit of the Tamers. They came, they drank, and they conquered! The Southport fans are leaving the Cliffside Pitch today with nothing but salt in their wounds and a massive hangover tomorrow morning. No one can say Trollball isn't the greatest sport in Osterra after a display like that! 🏆🍾\n\nFinal Score: Oread's Summit Tamers 5, Southport Narwhals 0. The Narwhals had the home-field advantage with those Gale-Force Winds, but they just couldn't handle the mountain-brewed fury of the Tamers! Loralyn Lyndy is left holding the ball at the whistle, but it's cold comfort for a team that got shut out in their own backyard. 🏟️🚫\n\nSo, as the sun sets over the lighthouse and the players are carried off—some for injuries, most for intoxication—remember: in Trollball, the only thing that matters is how hard you hit and how much you can hold! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off from the most beautiful, bloody, and boozy Tuesday night in history! Stay wicked, Osterra! 😈🎙️",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ STEP RIGHT UP TO THE BLOODIEST SHOW ON OSTERRA! 🎙️\n\nHello, sports fans, ghouls, and unfortunate souls trapped in the Everwar! This is Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the Prismatic Pavilion, where the air is thick with the scent of salt water and impending trauma! We’ve got a real Tuesday Night humdinger for you as my absolute favorites, the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, bring their delightful filth to the high-falutin' stilts of the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres**! Oh, you can just smell the mud and the noxious fumes wafting off our boys from the Ebon Gate, and it smells like victory! 🦴💥\n\nBefore the opening whistle, I took a peek into the locker rooms! The Corruptors are looking sharp; Amedeo Bari was seen polishing his boots with bacon grease—now that’s what I call a slick move for a slippery field! Meanwhile, over in the Bizarres’ camp, Gagliano Tallbott was seen telling a terrible joke to the Trollball. I hope that leather head has a sense of humor, because it’s about to get kicked across the lagoon! \n\nWe’re perched right over the Starlight Lagoon, folks, and these stage-planks are as unstable as a Warlock’s promise! Kython and his Prismatic Troupe are everywhere, making a real nuisance of themselves, but don’t let the bright colors fool you—the only thing turning red today will be the floorboards! Let’s get ready for some beautiful, bone-crunching Trollball! 🎪🔥",
    "postGame": "### 🏟️ AN ABSOLUTE CORKER AT THE PAVILION! 🏟️\n\nWhat a day for the history books, folks! We just witnessed a display of athletic brutality that would make Lord Orzalon himself weep with joy! It was a seesaw battle of brains, brawn, and broken bones right here on the edge of the lagoon. While the crowds might be thin—honestly, where is the support for these local icons? Probably busy watching those bores in Zmeigorod—the action was thicker than the mud in Ebon Gate! 🌊🏒\n\nThings started off with a bang when Amedeo Bari snatched up that beautiful, rotting troll head right in the center field! The Corruptors were moving like a well-oiled machine. Judi Carrington, singing a sea shanty that was mercifully drowned out by the sound of cracking ribs, charged down the field. Despite some early misses, Carrington found the opening and **DUNKS THE BALL**! A beautiful 1-point lead for the good guys! I haven't seen a more satisfying plunge since Sir Tanos fell into that spike pit! 🏆✨\n\nBut oh, the Bizarres didn't come to play nice! Aggri Cookie—what a name for a monster!—absolutely leveled Napoleon Anzovin early on. The sound of that Kirkhammer hitting the planks was music to my ears, even if it meant Napoleon had to take a little nap on the sidelines. Terle Chenay, our lovely healer, had her work cut out for her, belching her way through the revival process to get our boy back in the game! 🔨🤢\n\nThen came the play of the half! Aggri Cookie, showing a level of focus I usually only reserve for torturing adventurers, lined up a shot from way back in the Away Field. He let it fly, and—Swoosh!—right through the goal for **2 POINTS**! A spectacular 'Shoot' that turned the tide and put the Bizarres in the lead! You won't see that kind of precision from those 'heroes' like Artorias; he’s too busy admiring his own reflection! 🎯💥\n\nThe violence only escalated from there! Bullion Iglesias, fresh off a silent meditation session, decided to share some peace and quiet with Gagliano Tallbott by knocking him into the next reality! But the Bizarres struck back, with Bush Heiner delivering a tackle on Smith Syst that probably rattled her ancestors. It was a beautiful display of the 'Everwar' spirit—nobody stays down for long, and everyone loses their memory of why they’re bleeding! 🩸😵\n\nHalftime hit like a cooling breeze, giving everyone a chance to reattach their limbs. But the second half was a defensive masterclass. We saw a flurry of failed tackles as players slipped and slid on the Lagoon-splashed planks. Simsar Carrelli was counting clouds one minute and clutching the ball the next, but the Bizarres' defense was like a wall of glitter and steel. 🛡️☁️\n\nMilo Nelie showed us the business end of a military fork, sending Bullion Iglesias back to the healer’s tent. It’s a crying shame, really! Bullion was just starting to find his rhythm. Then Kristin Kronfeld followed up by injuring Ahasuerus An. The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres were playing like they had something to prove to Kython and the rest of those circus performers! 🍴💢\n\nAs the clock ticked down, the desperation was palpable! Amedeo Bari and Ellette Paz were throwing wild passes that went nowhere but the floor—perhaps the bacon grease on Bari's boots made the ball a bit too slippery? You've got to admire the commitment to the bit! Willa Lois managed to scoop it up for the Bizarres, keeping the pressure on the Corruptors in their own Home Field. 🐖🏈\n\nIn the final moments, Bullion Iglesias—who had been returned to play by the tireless Terle Chenay—got a bit of revenge by absolutely leveling Aggri Cookie! It was a glorious tackle that left the goal-scorer seeing stars that weren't part of the pavilion's decor! But alas, the clock ran out before my beloved Corruptors could capitalize on the chaos. ⭐️👊\n\nThe final whistle blows, and it’s a victory for the home team! The **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres walk away with 2 points** to the **Ebon Gate Corruptors' 1**. A heartbreaking loss for the filthiest team in the league, but what a display of carnage! If you weren't here to see the splinters fly, you missed a classic! 🎪🏁\n\nSo, as the sun sets over Osterra and the players head off to lose their memories of this glorious beating, remember: Trollball is the only thing that matters in this god-forsaken reality! Don't go following any 'White Ravens' or 'High Princes'—stay right here for the gore! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! Goodnight, and may your armor always be thicker than your skull! 🎙️👹",

    "preGame": "### 🎙️ WELCOME TO THE HOLLOW MINE, FOLKS! 🎙️\n\nStep right up and feast your eyes on the most glorious spectacle in all of Osterra! It’s Tuesday Night Trollball, and boy, do we have a doozy for you! I’m your host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the wildflower-covered clearing of Wyrmwood Hollow! Can you feel that humming in the earth, listeners? That’s not just the Mine Draft—that's the raw, unadulterated energy of impending carnage! Our home team, **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers**, are emerging from that ivy-covered mine shaft, and they look ready to crack some skulls for the glory of The Grove! \n\nOn the other side of the pitch, we’ve got the high-rolling, gold-counting visitors, **The New Prosperity Profits**! They’ve traded their velvet-lined counting houses for the mud and blood of the Hollow Mine. I caught a glimpse of their healer, Merissa Mathian, washing her hands with dirt earlier—a classic ritual to remind her that even the wealthiest merchant ends up in the ground eventually! And keep an eye on Pulchi Benyamin; she was seen devouring dandelions, stem and all, like a woman possessed! They’ve got that backing from the Merchant's Guild, probably hoping Brennan Farno’s luck rubs off on them, though I suspect that kissless money-priest is too busy counting his copper to care about a few broken ribs!\n\nBut don't count out the Stronghammers! These guys are as rugged as the Mine itself. Ultun Barthelemy spent his warm-ups braiding a teammate’s nose hair—now that’s the kind of team bonding that wins championships! And Autumn Jodoin? He just chugged a raw egg, shell and all! That's the kind of grit that makes a demon’s heart skip a beat. The crowd is buzzing, the Tangled Vines are twitching, and while they aren't quite my beloved Ebon Gate Corruptors, I expect enough violence to make even Lord Orzalon crack a smile in his cell! Let's get to the action! 🛡️🦴💥",
    "postGame": "### 💥 FINAL SCORE: PROFITS 2 - STRONGHAMMERS 3 💥\n\nWhat a magnificently messy affair we witnessed tonight, sports fans! The Wyrmwood Stronghammers have defended their turf in a display of sheer, unbridled brutality that would make any red-blooded demon weep with joy! It was a seesaw of shattered bones and stolen possessions from the very first whistle! \n\nThings got off to a roaring start when Odelia Abbott absolutely leveled Pulchi Benyamin, sending the Profits' star to the dirt early with a sickening crunch! You love to see it! But the Profits weren't about to let that slide. Yoshi Cathy sought immediate vengeance, tackling Odelia right back into the infirmary. It’s that kind of 'eye for an eye' mentality that keeps the fans coming back, even if Governor-King Zenku would probably hide behind his mask at the sight of such beautiful violence!\n\nJust when the Stronghammers thought they had the momentum, Abramson Doxia stepped up and put Godart Urissa out of commission! The crowd was roaring, the earth was humming, and the stadium was practically vibrating with the thrill of the hunt. Amidst the chaos, Faina Hendrix showed why those merchant-backed suits are so dangerous, launching a spectacular shot from the Home Field to put the Profits up by two points! \n\nBut the Stronghammers are built of sterner stuff than the soft, pampered bankers of New Prosperity. Autumn Jodoin, fueled by that raw egg he ate pre-game, missed his first shot but didn't let that stop him! He scooped that leather head right back up and nailed a shot from the Away Field to tie it up! Talk about a comeback that would leave those fancy Haven Lights crying for their mothers! \n\nHalftime saw Hamburger Marthe and Merissa Mathian working overtime to stitch their players back together. It’s the Everwar way, folks—die, get up, and do it again! The atmosphere in the second half was thick enough to choke a gargoyle, especially with the Mine Draft blowing through the clearing, chilling the players to the bone.\n\nThen came the play of the game! Ultun Barthelemy, with nose hair still impeccably braided, charged through the defense like a runaway cart and dunked that troll head straight into the goal! A touchdown for the ages! The Wyrmwood fans went absolutely wild, nearly drowning out the sound of Faina Hendrix trying to break Cornela Piscatelli in half—which he did, by the way! Another injury for the highlight reel! \n\nGodart Urissa returned to the field with a vengeance, proving that being knocked out only makes you angrier. Godart went on a rampage, injuring Gladdie Farika and then circling back to put Pulchi Benyamin back in the dirt! It was a masterclass in persistence, folks! If only Sir Randy had that kind of aim with his fancy bow, the Wardens might actually get something done for once!\n\nThe Profits tried to orchestrate a late-game miracle, but their coordination fell apart faster than one of Chairman Toland’s stale biscuits. Passes were dropped, tackles were missed, and Milman Galvan even found time to put Rebane Kendy out of the game just for good measure. The Stronghammers’ defense held firm as the clock ticked down!\n\nIn the end, the Guilder's gold couldn't buy a victory tonight. The Wyrmwood Stronghammers walked away with a 3-2 win, leaving the Profits to lick their wounds and count their losses. I hope Brennan Farno enjoys explaining this deficit to the Guild! \n\nWhat a night! What a game! No heroes here, just winners and the soon-to-be-resurrected losers! This is Nok the Corrupter signing off from Tuesday Night Trollball! Stay vicious, Osterra! 🏟️👹🔥",

    "preGame": "# 🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL PRE-GAME SPECTACULAR! \n\nHello there, sports fans, ghouls, and battle-hardened veterans! It's your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the most precarious pile of rocks in Osterra—The Serpent's Pass! 🐍 Boy oh boy, you can feel the altitude sickness kicking in already, and the fans are absolutely losing their minds! The Zmeigorod Snessengers are the talk of the town, and looking at this crowd, you'd think Valos the Eternal herself was handing out free gold! The Greenwatch has showed up too, though they look a bit out of their element away from their hallowed ground. \n\nSpeaking of ritual, let’s look at the pre-game prep! Over in the Snessengers' dugout, Delija Dowling just downed a raw egg, shell and all! That’s what I call a crunchy start! Meanwhile, Evalyn Pierrepont is meticulously polishing a helmet with a live snail. Slow and steady wins the race, or at least makes for a very slimy tackle! \n\nBut don't count out the Greenwatch! Verne Methuselah is currently rubbing the Trollball all over her armpits for that extra 'grip'—disgusting, yet effective! And Madea Mensch is hopping around with his bootlaces tied together. It’s a real circus out here, folks, and we haven't even started the bleeding yet! Sir Randy’s favorite rangers better watch their step, because this stadium is sinking faster than a lead weight in a bog! Let's get to the action! 🛡️⚡",
    "postGame": "# 🏆 THE FINAL WHISTLE: A BOG-SOAKED OVERTIME THRILLER! \n\n## 🏟️ The Snessengers Slide to Victory! \n\nHoly smokes, what a humdinger of a match! My voice is practically gone, but my spirit is soaring higher than a harpy! We just witnessed a marathon of carnage that would make Lord Orzalon weep with joy! The Zmeigorod Snessengers have defended their sinking home turf with a 5-4 victory over The Greenwatch in a sudden-death Overtime that had the fans falling out of their seats—literally, because of the rockslides! \n\n## ⚔️ Early Brutality! \n\nThe game started with a real crack as Evalyn Pierrepont showed the Greenwatch exactly why you don't bring a fancy bow to a Seax fight! She absolutely leveled Darin Berliner early on, sending her straight to the sidelines. Not to be outdone, Pierrepont went back for seconds, flattening Nobe Haukom and leaving the Greenwatch looking like they’d been run over by a wagon train! \n\n## 🏀 High-Stakes Scoring! \n\nBut the Greenwatch wouldn't stay down! Rese Halpern showed some real gumption, dodging through the mud to dunk the ball right into the goal! It was a beautiful sight, folks—the kind of play that makes you forget for a second that these 'heroes' are usually so insufferable. She really showed those Wardens how it's done! \n\n## 🩹 The Healers' Heroics! \n\nWaldon Tadeo was working overtime in the Snessengers' pit, patching up Avaria Revell and getting her back into the fray just in time! Nariko Javed for the Greenwatch was no slouch either, wiggling those fingers to bring Darin Berliner back from the brink. It's a miracle anyone is still in one piece with the way Northway Orran was swinging that machete! \n\n## 🌩️ Weathering the Storm! \n\nThe Serpent's Pass lived up to its name, folks! Between the altitude and the sinking field, the players were sliding around like greased pigs. Northway Orran managed a spectacular shot from center field despite the downpour, keeping the score neck-and-neck! You could see the frustration on the faces of the Greenwatch—probably wishing they were back under their Scarred Oak! \n\n## 🩸 Blood on the Grass! \n\nAs we hit the second half, the violence only ramped up! Darin Berliner, seeking revenge, absolutely clobbered Dare Wynnie! Not to be outdone, Drona Jacklin put Kleinstein MacGregor into the dirt. It was a beautiful symphony of groans and clashing steel, a real treat for the senses! \n\n## 🏹 The Warden's Resistance! \n\nTroy Jorgan for the Greenwatch managed a spectacular score from center field, momentarily silencing the Zmeigorod faithful. It looked like the 'heroes' might actually pull it off! I almost felt a tinge of disappointment, but then I remembered my favorite team wasn't playing, so I just settled in for more mayhem! \n\n## 🕒 Overtime Madness! \n\nWhen the clock ran out at 4-4, we headed into Overtime! The tension was thicker than the swamp gas! Both teams were exhausted, breaths hitching in the thin air. The fans were chanting so loud you could barely hear the bones snapping! \n\n## 🔱 The Winning Dunk! \n\nFinally, the moment of truth! Arni Griffith, who had been giving the Trollball a heroic backstory all afternoon, finally became the hero of his own tale! He broke through the Greenwatch defense and slammed that leather head into the goal for the win! The crowd erupted like a volcano! \n\n## 🏁 Final Thoughts! \n\nFinal score: Zmeigorod Snessengers 5, The Greenwatch 4! What a night for the bog-dwellers! Sir Randy and his Rangers are going home with bruised egos and even bruisier shins. Valos the Eternal must be cackling in her bog tonight! This is Nok the Corrupter signing off—keep your weapons sharp and your healers close! See you next Tuesday! 🎤👹",
