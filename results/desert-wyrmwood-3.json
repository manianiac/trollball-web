This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting live from the absolutely scorching Sun-Baked Bowl, deep in the Great Desert! The heat is rolling off the sand in waves you can see, and let me tell you, it's the perfect weather for some hard hits and glorious gridiron violence!\n\nTonight, we have a fantastic matchup for you! In one corner, making their way from the cool, damp earth of their home, we have The Wyrmwood Stronghammers! These folks are tough as old roots, and they've got some interesting ways of getting ready for a match. I saw Autumn Jodoin chugging a raw egg—shell and all!—while Ultun Barthelemy was busy braiding a teammate's nose hair. That’s the kind of dedication you love to see! If only the so-called leaders in Eponore had that kind of focus, maybe they wouldn't lose all their best warlocks.\n\nAnd in the other corner, basking in their home-field advantage, are The Desert Spectres! These warriors are as unforgiving as the sun above us. And their rituals? Just as intense! Angelita Darce is sporting a freshly half-shaved mustache for the occasion, a bold and frankly beautiful choice. And you gotta love a player like Steve, who's already got a betting pool going on who will score first. Now that's a competitor after my own black heart, unlike that Yarp fella who won't even take my wagers anymore!\n\nThe air is thick with anticipation and sand, folks. Will the oppressive heat cook the Stronghammers, or will their forest fortitude win the day? Will the Spectres use the desert winds to their advantage? It's anyone's game, and it’s about to get brutal! Grab your refreshments, place your bets, and get ready for some TROLLBALL!","postGame":"WOW! WHAT A FINISH! WHAT A GAME! Folks, if you weren't on the edge of your seat for that one, you might need to check if you've been KO'd! That was Trollball at its absolute finest, a back-and-forth brawl that went right down to the wire!\n\nFor those of you just tuning in, you missed an absolute classic. The Desert Spectres have snatched victory from the jaws of the Wyrmwood Stronghammers in a grueling overtime battle, with a final score of 2 to 1! What a spectacle!\n\nThe second half kicked off with a bang! Huesman Ring of the Spectres made a magnificent run, but the field immediately turned into a beautiful canvas of carnage! We saw Ultun Barthelemy take Steve out of the action, only for Huesman Ring and Sondra Elaina to knock each other out simultaneously! You love to see that mutual destruction! It's a kind of beautiful, brutal poetry that someone like Dame Terra Monteforte, who just plays with dirt, could never understand.\n\nAnd the hits kept on coming! Sabian Gleason and Fidellia Mozelle traded blows and both went down for a nap! The healers were earning their pay tonight, folks, especially the Spectres' own Verlee Dacia, who seemed to be everywhere at once!\n\nAmidst the chaos, the Spectres drew first blood! Bahr Ethelstan found the freshly-revived Steve with a perfect pass, and Steve powered it in for the first point of the game! The home crowd went wild! It looked like the Spectres might run away with it.\n\nBut you can never count out the Stronghammers! After a frantic series of fumbles and turnovers at center field, Rebane Kendy uncorked a beautiful throw to Autumn Jodoin. While Jodoin's shot at the goal fell short, the ever-ready Ultun Barthelemy was right there to scoop up the loose troll head and punch it in for a score! We were all tied up, one to one!\n\nThat's when things got REALLY interesting. The intensity cranked up to eleven! We saw more double knockouts as Odelia Abbott and Heyes Iver traded devastating shots! Then Steve and Sondra Elaina decided they hadn't had enough of each other and took each other out AGAIN! This is the kind of passion that wins championships, not hiding behind walls and fancy titles like those Chairmen in the Guild of the Black Sky.\n\nThe clock ran out, but the score was tied! That's right, folks, we were headed to OVERTIME! The tension was so thick you could cut it with a Kriegsmesser!\n\nOvertime was a masterclass in desperation and grit. Rebane Kendy of the Stronghammers came out like a man possessed, knocking out a player and moving the ball deep into Spectre territory. It looked like Wyrmwood was poised to win, but Steve, ever the spoiler, laid out Godart Urissa and forced the ball loose!\n\nThen, in the final, frantic moments, the ball found its way into the hands of Eileen Mikihisa. After being blocked once and losing the ball, Mikihisa fought to get it right back and, with the game on the line, broke through the defense and SCORED! THE DESERT SPECTRES WIN! THE DESERT SPECTRES WIN IN OVERTIME! An unbelievable finish to an unforgettable game! Your final score: The Desert Spectres 2, The Wyrmwood Stronghammers 1! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! See you next week for more glorious violence!","week":3,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":1,"slug":"desert-wyrmwood-3"}
