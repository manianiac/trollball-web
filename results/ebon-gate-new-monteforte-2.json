This is **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE from the most beautiful, treacherous patch of swamp in all of Osterra—**The Sinking Field**! Can you smell that? That delightful bouquet of noxious fumes and stagnant water? It smells like... VICTORY! Tonight, we have a match that warms the cockles of my black, withered heart. My personal favorites, the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, are hosting the visitors from the rebelliously rowdy district, **The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**!\n\nLet me tell you, folks, the conditions tonight are absolutely atrocious, which means they are **PERFECT** for Trollball! The mud is thick, the sinkholes are hungry, and the scaffolding is looking particularly lethal. The Corruptors are looking sharp—or as sharp as you can look when covered in sludge. I saw **Amedeo Bari** in the locker room earlier, polishing his boots with bacon grease. Now that is a veteran move! Not only does it keep the leather supple, but it also attracts the local vermin to distract the opposition during a scrum. That's the kind of tactical genius I expect from the home team!\n\nOn the other side, we have the Chaos Creatures, backed by those goody-two-shoes White Ravens. I hear **Dame Terra Monteforte** sends her regards, probably in the form of a strongly worded letter about \"zoning violations.\" Ha! You can keep your dirt magic, Terra; down here we play in the SLIME! I watched **Boulanger Procto** trying to arrange his gear in a perfect spiral before the match. Listen, kid, five minutes into this game, your gear is going to be arranged in a pile of broken splinters and bone shards! **Fogel Raynold** has the right idea, though—I saw them slapping their own helmet until their ears rang. That—right there—is the kind of pre-concussive preparation that wins championships! So grab your popcorn, hide your valuables, and get ready for a bloodbath!\n\n","postGame":"# 🏆 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT: CORRUPTORS REIGN SUPREME! 🏆\n\n**FINAL SCORE: Ebon Gate Corruptors 2 - New Monteforte Chaos Creatures 1**\n\nSWEET MOTHER OF MAYHEM! What a game! What a spectacle! If you missed this one, you missed a masterclass in incompetence, brutality, and accidental self-mutilation! The fans at the Sinking Field got their money's worth tonight, and the healers are going to be billing overtime for the next century! Let's break down this beautiful disaster!\n\nWe picked up the action right after the half, and things immediately went off the rails. **Raouf Dragone** of the Chaos Creatures snagged the Trollball, looking to make a play. But the violence started early and often! We saw a magnificent double-knockout where **Fogel Raynold** and **Judi Carrington** just absolutely deleted each other from existence! Horseman's Pick meets Estoc, and *boom*! Both players down! That is the spirit of Trollball right there!\n\nThe healers were clearly inhaling too many of those swamp fumes tonight, folks. I saw **Terle Chenay** reviving players from the *other team* at one point! Or maybe the mud was just so thick they couldn't tell friend from foe! It was absolute anarchy! **Raouf Dragone**, still trying to be a hero, managed to spike **As Utter** into the dirt with a Trident, but couldn't connect the pass to Simsar. Blocked by **Ellette Paz**, the ball hit the mud, and the scramble was on!\n\nPossession swung to the Corruptors when **Amedeo Bari** scooped up the leather. But let's talk about the highlight of the night, shall we? **Fogel Raynold**, perhaps confused by the ringing in his ears from his pre-game ritual, managed to KNOCK HIMSELF OUT. The stats don't lie, folks! \"Fogel Raynold knocks Fogel Raynold out of play with their Horseman's Pick.\" I haven't seen that level of coordination since **Sir Artorias** tried to dance at the Fey gala! Absolutely humiliating! Absolutely hilarious!\n\nWhile the Chaos Creatures were busy beating themselves up, **Amedeo Bari** made a break for it! He ran the ball all the way into Away territory, slipping past **Wolbrom Ariella** like a greased pig at a country fair. He went for the score... he launched the ball... and... DOINK! Just short! It landed in the 2-point zone! A heartbreaking miss for the Corruptors, but it kept the drama alive!\n\nThe game dragged into **OVERTIME**! The crowd was rioting! The sinkholes were opening! **Urata Oriana** tried to make something happen for Monteforte, but **Amedeo Bari**, looking for redemption, blocked the run and popped the ball loose. It was anyone's game! The tension was thick enough to cut with a rusty jagged knife!\n\nThen, we witnessed the glorious confusion of the Corruptors! **Simsar Carrelli** picked up the ball, and his own teammate, **As Utter**, decided that was the perfect time for a duel! **FRIENDLY FIRE, FOLKS!** As Utter smashed Simsar with a Greatsword, and Simsar retaliated with a Billhook! Both Corruptors knocked each other out while the ball rolled free! I haven't seen teamwork that bad since the **Guild of the Black Sky** tried to organize a charity lunch!\n\nBut from the ashes of stupidity, a hero arose! **Napoleon Anzovin**! With bodies littered everywhere, he grabbed the loose ball in the Away 2-Point zone. **Boulanger Procto**, his spirals long forgotten, tried to block him, but Napoleon would not be denied! He smashed through the defense and SCORED THE GAME WINNER!\n\n**THE EBON GATE CORRUPTORS WIN!** The Sinking Field erupts! The mud flies! Take that, New Monteforte! Take that, Dame Terra! You can keep your orderly streets and your shiny armor; tonight, the swamp reigns supreme! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off to go find out if Fogel Raynold has regained consciousness yet. Stay evil, Osterra!","week":2,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":1,"slug":"ebon-gate-new-monteforte-2"}
