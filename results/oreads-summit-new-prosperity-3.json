This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolutely breathtaking, and I do mean that literally, High-Pass Pitch in Oread's Summit! The air up here is so thin it'll make your lungs scream, and the winds are colder than a tax collector's heart! It's the perfect weather for some bone-shattering, soul-stirring Trollball!\n\nTonight, our hometown heroes, The Oread's Summit Tamers, are looking to tame more than just mountains as they face off against the visiting New Prosperity Profits! The Tamers are looking FIERCE, folks! I saw Saloma Talich getting a teammate to punch him square in the shoulder just to get the blood flowing, and Edme Virgil is warming up their vocal cords with a sea shanty that could curdle milk! Now THAT is preparation!\n\nThe Profits aren't just here to count their gold, either! These scrappers from the Guild of the Black Sky mean business. I watched Yoshi Cathy eat a raw onion, layer by layer, without shedding a single tear. If that doesn't tell you he's ready to bring the pain, I don't know what will! And let's not forget Pulchi Benyamin, who's fueling up by eating a dandelion, stem and all! A little bit of nature before the unnatural carnage begins!\n\nThis is going to be a clash of titans, a battle of wills, a symphony of destruction! Will the high-altitude advantage and bizarre rituals of the Tamers carry them to victory? Or will the cold, calculating precision of the Profits pay dividends? Grab your grog, hold on to your helmets, because the whistle is about to blow, and the beautiful brutality is about to begin!","postGame":"WHAT A GAME! WHAT A NIGHT! Folks, if you weren't on the edge of your seat, you must have been knocked out of it! The Oread's Summit Tamers have defended their home turf with a stunning display of power and precision, putting down the New Prosperity Profits with a final score of 4 to 1! An absolute masterclass in violence and scoring!\n\nThe action started faster than a rumor in the Adventurer's Guild! The Profits' Gladdie Farika scooped up the ball, but BAM! Clippard Burr of the Tamers laid them out with a lance! But in a twist you only see in Trollball, Farika took Burr down with them! A double knockout on the first play! Oh, it brings a tear to my eye!\n\nWith the field already littered with bodies, the Tamers seized the moment! Dric Trilley grabbed the troll head and went on a rampage, bowling over Pellikka Concettina like a ninepin! This is what the game is all about, my friends!\n\nAnd then, the moment of magic! Trilley zipped a pass to Zadoc Wyatan, who was waiting in the 2-point zone. Wyatan took aim, let it fly, and SWISH! Two points for the Tamers! The hometown crowd erupted!\n\nBut they weren't done! Not by a long shot! On the very next possession, Saloma Talich got the ball at center field, looked at the goal, and just CHUCKED IT! I've never seen anything like it! The ball sailed through the air and right through the hoop for another TWO POINTS! In the blink of an eye, the Tamers were up 4-0! The Profits looked absolutely stunned!\n\nThe first half was a whirlwind of beautiful brutality! Swamy Ahasuerus and Aufmann Tedric traded knockouts, Edme Virgil and Clippard Burr took each other out of the game... the healers were working harder than Sir Artorias's publicist! It was glorious chaos, a testament to the spirit of the sport!\n\nAfter a much-needed halftime where the healers scraped our warriors off the pitch and glued them back together, the second half began. The Profits knew they had a mountain to climb, and to their credit, they came out fighting!\n\nKrueger Jacinthe finally put the visitors on the board, bulldozing his way into the endzone for a touchdown! A glimmer of hope for the Profits, making the score 4-1. Could they mount a comeback for the ages?\n\nThey certainly tried! Abramson Doxia made a fantastic run deep into Tamer territory, dodging and weaving, looking for an opening. But the Tamers' defense stiffened, becoming an unbreakable wall of muscle and steel. Possession was wrestled back and forth, the ball dropped and recovered in frantic scrambles that looked more like a mosh pit than a sporting event! It was magnificent!\n\nIn the end, the Tamers' early lead and tenacious defense were too much to overcome. As the final whistle blew, it was Swamy Ahasuerus holding the ball, and the victory, firmly in her grasp. A well-deserved win for The Oread's Summit Tamers, who showed everyone tonight how Trollball is played in the mountains! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that a broken bone is just a souvenir from a game well played!","week":3,"homeScore":4,"awayScore":1,"slug":"oreads-summit-new-prosperity-3"}
