    "content": "# Runic Roundup - Week 6\n**By Owain Fairwind, First Aeronaut in Osterra**\n*Brought to you by the Toast and Melt - Grilled cheese for sale, questions encouraged!*\n\nHello sports fans and assorted heroes of the realm, I am demonstrably not Nok the Corrupter. No, I am **Owain Fairwind**, your friendly sandwich monger and aeronaut. At the recent Trollball Celebratory match hosted in the Yule Glade, I was enjoying a tasty grilled cheese sandwich from the **Toast and Melt**, made with only the finest of breads and cheeses, when I happened to strike up a conversation with an entity that I didn’t recognize. After chatting a bit about the game (and selling said entity some grilled cheese) I found out that this was none other than Nok the Corrupter. Being a huge fan of his game recaps, I offered to write a feature of my own and thus the **Runic Roundup** was born.\n\nEach week, I’ll examine a few of the key matchups and then read the runes. Using the runic divinatory system from my world (that you can read about in my scholarly works), I’ll be trying to make predictions about some of the games of the week and other flows of the season. And of course, I’m available to answer any questions you might have about my predictions, my research, or the delicious sandwiches at the Toast and Melt.\n\nAs a note, I’ve only been in Osterra for a year, so my knowledge of Osterra Geography is still somewhat limited, this will likely impact the accuracy of my predictions as my knowledge of the character of the cities of the various teams is incomplete at best. Still, I’ll be offering information about the runes that I draw and you can come to your own conclusions.\n\nThis week, we’ll be looking at whether the winning streak of the currently undefeated **Southport Narwhals** will be broken and by whom, whether the losing streak of the currently unvictorious **Oak & Onslaught** will come to an end before the season does, and whether the **New Prosperity Profits** will prosper this week or if the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** will pull off a bizarre upset.\n\n## Southport Supremacy?\n\nThe **Narwhals** have an interesting schedule coming up with Week 6 bringing them up against the **New Haven Lights** (#10), Week 7 seeing them facing **The Oread’s Summit Tamers** (#7), and Week 8 matching them up with the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** (#17). The Lights and the Tamers both have winning records (3-2) so far this season with the Tamers being ranked higher on point differential. Both teams are made up of skilled players, even if Nok has a grudge against the Lights. The Fire Eaters are on a bit of a losing streak at the moment with their one win for the season coming on Week 1 against the Spectres. Still, an underdog story is never something one should count out, so it could be them that finally unseat the Narwhals.\n\nI decided to draw one rune for each of these games, replacing the rune each time so each trial is independent. The rune here represents the performance of the team under examination, so the Narwhals, throughout the game. For the first rune, I drew **Jera**, the rune of knowledge, growth, longevity, gains over time, the cycle of life, and elemental earth. Gains over time seems to be the most relevant meaning here. This rune would seem to indicate that their score will grow throughout the game, likely leading to a victory.\n\nFor the second rune, I drew **Raido**, the rune of union, reunion, communication, journeys, and travel. The game is a home game for the Narwhals or I would say that journeys and travel play a big role in the meaning here, particularly since the runes drawn are meant to represent the performance of the Narwhals. We therefore should look to a meaning more like union or communication which in the context of a sporting event, likely indicates a well coordinated team. This suggests a likely Narwhal victory as well.\n\nFor the third rune, I drew **Isa**, the rune of standstill, withdrawal, and stasis. That can’t be a good sign for performance. It would seem to suggest the Narwhals are going to choke at the end. I predict Southport will continue its winning streak until screeching to a standstill.\n\n## Oak, Onslaught, and Only Losses?\n\nWe now turn our attention to **Oak and Onslaught**, the team from Fletchings. So far, Oak and Onslaught have been on a losing streak, not having managed a single win in the first 5 weeks of the league. Their remaining matchups are not particularly strong. Week 6 they are facing the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** in an away game. Brimstone is currently rank 17, just one win under their belt. Week 7 sees the oakiest team facing their hardest remaining opponent, **Desert Spectres**, also in an away game. The Spectres are rank 9, the middle of the pack but still presenting an uphill battle for Oak and Onslaught. Their final opponent is the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** in yet another away game. The Bizarres are ranked 15 with only one win. They are only ranked higher than the Fire Eaters due to the point differential. Once again, I’ll be drawing one rune to represent the performance of Oak and Onslaught in each game.\n\nThe first rune was **Ansuz**, representing messages, signals, actions at a distance, and elemental air. Actions at a distance is a good sign for Oak and Onslaught. They have had trouble getting points on the board, averaging less than a point a game, with three of their five games resulting in no points for them. Actions at a distance suggests they might have better luck with succeeding at the Mad King’s rule and get some two pointers up there. But taking action isn’t the same as succeeding. This feels murky to me but I’d give a slight edge to the trees.\n\nFor the second rune, I drew **Kano**. Kano, is a multifaceted rune. On the one hand it represents deconstruction and unraveling. On the other it represents clarification, illumination, showing the way, and spirit. These meanings often seem contradictory and the trick is to figure out either how they are related, or which of the meanings is more dominant given the rest of the reading. We’ll come back to this one after the third.\n\nThe final rune is **Uruz**, the rune of force, physical strength, and endings and beginnings. On the one hand, this could point to the end of Oak and Onslaught’s losing streak. It could also signal they are coming out in force. Either way, it points to good things for the team in this game. I’d say the signs are pointing towards a victory at this stage.\n\nSo the first game is murky, the second we still need to puzzle out the meaning, and the third points towards an Oaky victory. Taken together, this suggests a progression of sorts, as in a story. Messages and signals in Week 6, some risks with actions at a distance, these lead to a narrow victory for Oak and Onslaught. Feeling a bit cocky from their win, their offence unravels and they once again lose. But they come out in force for the last game of the season, managing to pull out 2 wins despite their currently unbroken losing streak.\n\n## Bazaar Profits?\n\nWe turn our attention to one particular matchup of the week. The **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** vs. The **New Prosperity Profits**. The Bizarres are coming off of a 3-0 win over the Kerlauger Runeguard, their only win of the season so far. The Profits have lost two games with their most recent against the Desert Spectres which went to overtime. Based on team performance alone, the Profits would seem to have an edge, but fans love an underdog and you can’t underestimate the impact of that. Plus, the Profits are playing an away game. The home court advantage might keep the Bizarres going and propel them to victory.\n\nFor this reading, we’re shaking up the format a little bit. For each half of the game, I’ll be drawing one rune to represent the performance of each team. I’ll then read those runes together to get a sense of how that half is going to go. If I think it’s likely to go to overtime, we’ll do the same thing for overtime.\n\nFor the first half, the **Bizarres** get **Eiwaz**, the rune of foresight, defense, and avertive powers. This rune has positive connotations in a sports (or combat) context but a strong defense is not always enough. For the **Profits**, I drew **Perth**, with two properties: that which is hidden, and death and rebirth. Using the second meaning, it could signal that the Profits will flounder initially before rallying but given the foresight meaning of the first rune, I think that which is hidden seems more likely to be relevant here. This would suggest Profits will execute a well hidden offensive strategy but the Bizarres will respond with a hell of a defense, forseeing the Profit’s moves and leading to a close match.\n\nFor the second half, the **Bizarres** get **Nauthiz**, meaning damage, necessity, and constraint. Damage might be a positive omen, Trollball is rather violent in fact, but the rune on its own doesn’t quite indicate who that damage will be done to. For the **Profits**, I got **Isa**, the rune of standstill, withdrawal, and stasis. Definitely not what Profits fans want to be seeing. Taken together, I’m predicting that both teams have trouble getting anything going, constraint and standstill? Not a recipe for a high scoring half. I think this thing is going to overtime!\n\nThat means one more set of runes to draw. The **Bizarres** get **Inguz**, with the properties aggression, combustion, and elemental fire. Aggression can be good in a sports setting, but combustion tends to flame out quickly if it can be blocked. For the **Profits**, I drew **Jera**, rune of knowledge, growth, longevity, gains over time, the cycle of life, and elemental earth. A little rough for the Profits here. The longevity of Jera will tend to outlast the combustion of Inguz.\n\nWith all this taken together, I predict a low scoring game with a narrow victory by the Profits.\n\n## Don’t shoot the messenger\n\nThat’s my best guess for how some of the remaining games are going to go. The runes can be mysterious at times and I still find Osterra somewhat inscrutable. I’m hopeful I can improve the accuracy of my predictions as I get more practice but for now, I hope you enjoy this divinatory exercise. However, I do see delicious grilled cheese from the Toast and Melt in your future!\n\n*Remember: the future is what you make of it!*"
