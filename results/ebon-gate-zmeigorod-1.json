TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL! This is your favorite host, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolute best stadium in all of Osterra, the magnificent Sinking Field in Ebon Gate! The noxious fumes are thick, the mud is extra soupy, and there's a rumor of a new sinkhole opening right in the center field. It's a perfect night for some real sport!\n\nTonight, my mighty, my magnificent, my **Ebon Gate Corruptors** are kicking off their season against some visitors from the swamp, The Zmeigorod Snessengers! Now, I've seen these Snessengers getting ready, and what a peculiar bunch! You've got Delija Dowling over there chugging raw eggs, shell and all! And Evalyn Pierrepont is polishing his helmet with a live snail! A SNAIL! I suppose when you live in a bog ruled by the so-called 'Bog Queen' Valos, you pick up some strange habits. Let's see if those slimy rituals help them navigate our beautiful, treacherous mud!\n\nBut let's talk about the real stars of the show! The Ebon Gate Corruptors are looking FIERCE tonight! I saw Smith Syst daring a teammate to eat a live worm for luck—now that's team spirit! And As Utter is looking focused, insisting on being the last one out of the locker room. That's the kind of dedication you don't see from those goody-two-shoes adventurers like Sir Artorias. The Corruptors are ready to bring the pain, and I for one can't wait to see them turn the field into a masterpiece of glorious destruction. Grab your grog, folks, because the whistle is about to blow, and the carnage is about to begin!","postGame":"### A Shocking Upset at The Sinking Field!\n\nWell, folks, I am beside myself. In a game that was wall-to-wall action from the opening whistle to the last, the visiting Zmeigorod Snessengers have pulled off an upset here in Ebon Gate. It was a slugfest, a real donnybrook, but the scoreboard tells a tale that is bitter to this old demon's heart.\n\n### First Half Frenzy\n\nThe action started immediately! The Snessengers got the ball, and Northway Orran came out swinging that Machete, knocking my Corruptors' own Simsar Carrelli right out of play! Not to be outdone, Dare Wynnie laid out Ellette Paz with a Quarterstaff! A brutal opening statement from the visitors.\n\nNorthway Orran then made a spectacular run, slipping past Amedeo Bari, but couldn't stick the landing for the score! The ball was loose, a prime opportunity! But that's when my man, the great As Utter, a warrior who would make Cyfnerth the Butcher proud, stepped up and flattened Dare Wynnie with his Greatsword! WHAT A HIT!\n\nPossession was a slippery thing tonight. The Corruptors' own Smith Syst scooped up the ball and, after a tense moment, zipped a perfect pass to Napoleon Anzovin! Anzovin made a great run but, like his Snessenger counterpart, just couldn't find the basket. The tension was palpable, ladies and gentlemen!\n\nThe Snessengers mounted another charge, with Evalyn Pierrepont and Kleinstein MacGregor connecting on a beautiful play to move deep into Corruptors territory. The violence was non-stop! Players were dropping like flies, with KOs traded back and forth in a beautiful, chaotic dance! It was everything you want in this wonderful sport!\n\nWhen the halftime whistle blew, the score was still knotted at zero, but the field was littered with bruised bodies and broken pride. A true stalemate of brutality!\n\n### The Decisive Second Half\n\nThe second half began with even more chaos! We had a spectacular double KO, with Ahasuerus An and Dare Wynnie taking each other down in a blaze of glory! You simply love to see that kind of mutual destruction!\n\nMy Corruptors looked poised to strike when Ellette Paz grabbed the ball, but a crucial block by Kleinstein MacGregor led to a turnover! A heartbreaker! MacGregor was then stopped cold by Bullion Iglesias, and the ball was loose once more!\n\nAnd then... it happened. Amidst the chaos of battle, with players locked in desperate combat all over the field, the Snessengers' Gere Cordelie got her hands on the Trollball in our home field. She looked up, she took a breath, and she let it fly.\n\nThe ball sailed through the swampy air, a perfect arc, and went straight through the hoop. A two-point shot for The Zmeigorod Snessengers. The crowd was stunned into silence. A lucky, infuriatingly perfect shot.\n\nThe Corruptors fought valiantly to the very end, but they just couldn't answer back. The final whistle blew on a scene of Snessenger celebration.\n\n### Final Score\n\nSo there you have it, folks. Your final score from The Sinking Field:\n\n*   **The Zmeigorod Snessengers: 2**\n*   **The Ebon Gate Corruptors: 0**\n\nA tough loss for the home team, but what a spectacular display of violence and mayhem! My Corruptors may have lost on the scoreboard, but they won in our hearts with their sheer ferocity. They'll be back, you can count on it! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!","week":1,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":2,"slug":"ebon-gate-zmeigorod-1"}
