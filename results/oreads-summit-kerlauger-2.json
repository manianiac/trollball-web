High-Pass Pitch** at Oread's Summit! Folks, the air is thin up here, but the tension is THICK enough to cut with a rusted cleaver! We’ve got a Week 2 spectacle that promises bruises, broken bones, and beautiful brutality! Tonight, the **Kerlauger Runeguard** have marched their way up the mountain to face the **Oread's Summit Tamers**! 🏔️⚔️\n\nThe Tamers are playing in their home clouds, backed by the **Prismatic Troupes**. You know, that circus led by Kython? I usually prefer my entertainment involves screaming rather than juggling, but on the Trollball pitch, hopefully, we get both! Their player **Alwyn Wandy** was seen whispering a secret fear to the ball earlier. Spooky! Or maybe just pathetic? We'll see! Meanwhile, **Odericus Juxon** has been slapping their own helmet until their ears ring. Now THAT is the kind of brain damage I like to see *before* the whistle blows! 🤡🎪\n\nAnd let's not forget our visitors, the Runeguard! They fly the banner of the **White Ravens**. Ah, yes, Colm's bunch. The man with the handshake of a wet fish and the luck of a black cat under a ladder. But their players are tough! **Lashondra Niehaus** warms up by getting punched in the shoulder, and **Harilda Sigsmond** has the whole team chanting like a cult! I love a good cult! 😈\n\nCan the Runeguard overcome the altitude and the vertigo? Will the Tamers put on a show or just get shown the door? Grab your popcorn and your bandages, folks, because it's **TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL!** Let the mayhem begin! 🩸🏈","postGame":"🏁 **GAME OVER! AND WHAT A SCRAP IT WAS!** 🏁\n\nKeep your healers on speed dial, folks, because the body count was high tonight! The **Kerlauger Runeguard** have scraped out a victory against the **Oread's Summit Tamers** with a final score of **3 to 2**! It was messy, it was chaotic, and it was absolutely DELIGHTFUL! 💀✨\n\nThe violence started immediately! **Lorilee Aldred** of the Runeguard introduced **Clippard Burr** to the floor with a Katar swipe that I felt in my own horns! But the real highlight of the first half was the rivalry between **Benjie Foulk** and **Mitran Mariand**. These two just couldn't stand each other! A beautiful double-knockout sent them both to the dirt early on! 👊💥 While the bodies were hitting the floor, **Johnna Beetner** slipped through the chaos, dancing past Swamy Ahasuerus to score a TOUCHDOWN for Kerlauger! **1-0 Runeguard!**\n\nThe first half ended with **Harilda Sigsmond** and **Zadoc Wyatan** trading blows until neither was left standing. A double knockout to end the half? That's poetry! 📜🩸\n\nAfter the break, things got WEIRD. **Shepperd Trefler** tried to make a play for the Runeguard but threw the ball right into the hands of the Tamer's **Zadoc Wyatan**! An interception! But wait! **Lashondra Niehaus** wasn't having any of that hero nonsense. She stripped the ball right back from Zadoc and launched a massive SHOOT from distance! **BAM! 2 POINTS!** The Runeguard go up **3-0**! What a swing! 🔄🚀\n\nBut the Tamers weren't dead yet! **Swamy Ahasuerus** caught a pass from a revived Mitran and answered back with a 2-point shot of their own! **3-2!** The tension was palpable! 😱\n\nThe final minutes were a desperate scramble. Lashondra tried to put it away but fell short. Alwyn Wandy tried to tie it up but couldn't get the distance! And just for old time's sake, **Benjie Foulk** and **Mitran Mariand** knocked each other out AGAIN! I think those two need to get a room or a duel to the death! 😂\n\nIn the end, the White Ravens' squad held on! Take that, Kython! Your circus acts couldn't juggle their way out of this beating! The **Kerlauger Runeguard** take the win! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off and reminding you: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how much blood you spill along the way! GOODNIGHT OSTERRA! 🌙👹","week":2,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":3,"slug":"oreads-summit-kerlauger-2"}
