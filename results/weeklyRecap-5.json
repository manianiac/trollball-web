Nok the Corrupter here, crawling out from under a pile of medical reports to bring you the glorious, gore-soaked highlights from Week 5 of Tuesday Night Trollball! If you love scoring, you were probably disappointed. But if you, like me, live for the CRUNCH of bone, the despair of a shutout, and the beautiful chaos of a sudden-death overtime, then this was the greatest week in the history of this magnificent sport! Grab a flagon of something questionable and let's wade through the viscera!\n\n## 🧱 THE GREAT WALLS OF PAIN! 🧱\n\nThis week was the week of the GOOSE EGG! 🥚 So many teams were sent home with nothing but bruises and shame! And who led the charge? None other than my beloved, the pride of the pit, the **EBON GATE CORRUPTORS**! They marched into Brimstone's sulfur-choked bowl and put on an absolute clinic, dismantling the Fire Eaters 3-0! Amedeo Bari launched a two-point missile that was a thing of beauty, and Ahasuerus An went on an injury-dealing rampage that would make Lord Orzalon proud! Sir Tanos, I hope you were watching your boys get absolutely humiliated! YES!\n\nBut the Corruptors weren't the only ones dishing out zeroes! The **Oread's Summit Tamers** must have been sick of being everyone's punching bag, because they unleashed fury on the Wardens' own Oak & Onslaught, crushing them 5-0! FIVE TO NOTHING! Odericus Juxon was handing out injuries like free samples! Sir Randy can polish his fancy bow all he wants, it won't fix his team's broken bones!\n\nEven the circus freaks got in on the action! The **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** put on a show, shutting out the Kerlauger Runeguard 3-0! I have to admit, seeing Kython's performers score is always a treat. And then there were the **Southport Narwhals**, who hosted an OPEN BAR and still managed to keep the New Monteforte Chaos Creatures off the board with a 2-0 victory! It was a masterpiece of drunken violence! The first half alone had more injuries than a royal banquet catered by Cyfnerth the Butcher! A thing of beauty!\n\nOf course, I am contractually obligated to report that the **Haven Lights** also won 2-0. *Yawn*. While they may have gotten the points, the **Confluence Captains** won the game of brutality. Ladew Evelina was a one-man wrecking crew, smashing bodies left and right. So congratulations, Haven, on your hollow, boring victory. The real winners are the healers who have to stitch your players back together.\n\n## 🕰️ DOWN TO THE WIRE, DOWN TO THE PAIN! 🕰️\n\nFolks, nothing gets my blood pumping like a game that goes to OVERTIME! It's a testament to two teams who hate each other so much they refuse to let the game end on time! We had a cavalcade of 1-0 thrillers this week, each one a defensive masterpiece.\n\nThe **New Ravenfall Commanders** scraped out a 1-0 victory against The Greenwatch on their cobblestone pitch. It was a brutal slog where tackles echoed off the castle walls! Theis Loredo and Croteau Osmo were absolute terrors! Falric's little forest friends go home with nothing!\n\nAnd what about the biggest upset of the night?! The **South Pole Yetis** took down the fan-favorite **Zmeigorod Snessengers**, 1-0 in OT! HA! I can hear the tears of their eight fans all the way from here! A beautiful, gritty win for the frontier folk, who sent the Snessengers slinking back to Valos's bog with their tails between their legs! You absolutely love to see it!\n\n## 🍻 OPEN BAR, OPEN WOUNDS! 🍻\n\nThere is nothing in this world more beautiful than a Trollball match where the players are sloshing with ale! The fumbles! The trips! The ill-advised passes! It's poetry! The **Desert Spectres** hosted the New Prosperity Profits in a sand-swept, booze-fueled overtime brawl, and it was glorious! Players were weaving, passes were flying into the dunes, but when the sand settled, it was **Angelita Darce** with a magnificent two-point shot to win it 3-1! Take that, Brennen Farno! Your money can't buy you a tolerance!\n\nWhat a week, folks! We saw utter domination, nail-biting finishes, and glorious, drunken incompetence. This is what Trollball is all about! The heroes cried, the villains cheered, and the healers have a lot of work to do. Perfect.\n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that pain is temporary, but a loss in the record books is forever! Stay violent, Osterra! 👹"
