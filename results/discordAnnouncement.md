📢 **EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT! IT’S TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL!** 📢

Greetings, you ghouls, gear-heads, and gore-seekers! This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, **Nok the Corrupter**, broadcasting live from the heart of the carnage! If your week hasn't been filled with the sound of snapping bone and the sweet scent of sulfur, then you simply haven't been paying attention to the most beautiful sport in all of Osterra! 🏟️👹

Boy howdy, Week 7 was a real doozy—a regular volcanic eruption of athletic violence! We saw rivalries that would make the Everwar look like a polite tea party at Maple’s grove! 🌳☕

Here’s a taste of the trauma we witnessed:

🏯 **A Clash at the Castle!** The Haven Lights took their self-righteous glow into the Stronghold Bailey to face the New Ravenfall Commanders! Was the "Shield" of Haven enough to stop the heavy-hitting Commanders, or did the Rampart Shadows swallow up those shiny suits of armor? Let’s just say someone's bootlaces were tied in knots, and someone's ribs are currently in more pieces than a shattered mirror! 🕯️⚔️

🍻 **The Taps Were Open!** We had TWO matches where the ale was flowing faster than the River Styx! Out in the dunes and high on the mountain passes, the "liquid courage" led to some truly imaginative marksmanship and even more imaginative fumbling! We saw players stumbling around like Sir Randy trying to find his targets without that fancy bow of his! Did the drunkards find the basket, or did they just find the dirt? 🍺😵

⏱️ **Overtime Operas!** Not one, but TWO games couldn't be settled by the final whistle! We’re talking sudden-death marathons in the Su’akour Bowl and the Old Fort! When you’ve got warriors charging through noxious fumes and shifting fog for that one final dunk, you know the healers like Raphael Miyasawa and Eugen Zacks were earning every copper! 🏥🦴

🎪 **Bizarre Brutality!** My absolute favorites, the Ebon Gate Corruptors, took their delightful filth to the Prismatic Pavilion! Between the bacon grease and the stage-planks, it was a slippery struggle for the soul of the lagoon! Did the Pride of the Pit prevail, or did Kython’s glittery circus performers pull a rabbit—or a troll head—out of a hat? 🌋✨

You simply *must* get the full, bone-crunching details! Head on over to the **[Trollball Website](https://blacksky.wiki/blog)** for the complete match recaps, injury reports, and more statistics than Chairman Brennen Farno could count in a century! 🖱️📜

🗳️ **CALL TO ACTION: THE POPULARITY POLLS!**
The fans have spoken, and it seems the Zmeigorod Snessengers are still hogging all the attention! I know popularity doesn’t win games, but it certainly fills the stands. Next time the poll appears, make sure you VOTE for your favorite squad! Let’s see if anyone can knock those snakes off their pedestal, or if my Corruptors can finally get a single fan who isn't a starving wolf! 🐍🗳️

This is **Nok the Corrupter**, reminding you: if you’re not bleeding, you’re not trying! Stay corrupted, Osterra! 🎙️🖤
