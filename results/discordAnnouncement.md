# 👹🎙️ TUESDAY NIGHT TROLLBALL REPORT: WEEK 4 🎙️👹

**GOOD EVENING, SPORTS FANS, GHOULS, AND GAMBLERS!**

This is **Nok the Corrupter**, broadcasting LIVE across the planes to bring you the bloodiest, booziest, and most BRUTAL update of the season! The dust has settled, the medics are working overtime, and let me tell you—Osterra has never seen violence quite like this!

If you missed this week's matches, you missed HISTORY! We had **High Altitude showdowns**, **Swamp invasions**, and a scoreboard that nearly caught fire from overuse! 🔥

Here is a taste of the carnage you missed:

🍻 **OPEN BAR MAYHEM!**
The Commissioner cracked the kegs not once, but TWICE this week! We had drunken brawls in the **Sun-Baked Bowl** and a liquor-fueled riot at the **Buccaneer's Bowl**! You haven't lived until you've seen a Yeti try to tackle a Privateer while seeing three of them! The coordination was low, but the entertainment value was HIGH! 🥴🏝️

🎪 **SCOREBOARD EXPLOSION!**
The **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** and the **Wyrmwood Stronghammers** put on an absolute clinic in offense (and a disaster in defense)! The score went back and forth faster than a goblin thief! We saw **15 POINTS** put on the board in a single game! 🤯 The Prismatic Troupe and the Grove's finest left everything on the field!

🏥 **HEADHUNTER OF THE WEEK**
A tip of the hat to **Dusa Curson** of the **New Ravenfall Commanders**. While the fans might not love the team from the castle (Zero votes? Ouch!), Dusa managed a **TRIPLE INJURY** performance! 🚑🚑🚑 That is a Hat-Trick of Hospitalizations, folks! Sir Artorias should give that demon a medal!

🐍 **THE SWAMP LEGION**
I see the polls! **The Zmeigorod Snessengers** have an absolute ARMY of fans behind them! Valos the Eternal must be handing out free bog-water! They marched on **New Ravenfall** this week—did the fan favorites survive the stone walls, or did the castle crumble? You'll have to read to find out!

😈 **MY CORRUPTORS**
And of course, my beautiful **Ebon Gate Corruptors** climbed the dizzying heights of Oread's Summit. Did they succumb to the thin air, or did they drag the Tamers down into the mud? (I think you know who I was cheering for!)
