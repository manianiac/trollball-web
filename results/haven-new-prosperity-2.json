gore-hounds, and degenerate gamblers!** This is your host, the voice of violence, the sultan of slaughter, **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE! Folks, hold your noses because we are broadcasting from the most nauseatingly sanitary place in the realm—**The Aegis Field** in Haven! Ugh, I can smell the incense and self-righteousness from the booth. It burns my sensitive nostrils! They call it \"Hallowed Ground,\" but I call it a perfect canvas for some arterial spray!\n\nTonight, we have a clash that screams \"class warfare\"! In the visiting dugout, funded by the deep pockets of the **Guild of the Black Sky**, we have **The New Prosperity Profits**! I hear **Chairman Brennen Farno** actually paused counting his gold coins to wish them luck. Or maybe he was just checking his reflection in a mirror. Who knows with that guy? And facing them, the home team, the do-gooders, the team I personally hope gets turned into a fine paste... **The Haven Lights**! 🤮\n\nLet's look at the players warming up down there. I see **Pulchi Benyamin** for the Profits... is she... yes, folks, she is eating a dandelion. Dirt, stem, and all. That is the kind of unhinged, feral energy we love to see! Meanwhile, on the Haven side, **Dickenson Beker** is over there trying to teach a stray dog to... shake? Sit? Do long division? Beker, honey, focus on the game, or you're going to get flattened! \n\nThe air is crisp, the weapons are sharp, and the Healers are on standby (hopefully not too sober). It's time for **TROLLBALL!**","postGame":"# 🩸 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT 🩸\n\n**HAHAHA! EXTINGUISHED! SNUFFED OUT!** The Haven Lights didn't just lose tonight, folks; they were humiliated in their own backyard! The final score is a beautiful, lopsided **5 to 0** for **The New Prosperity Profits**! I haven't seen a beating this one-sided since I played cards with **Geth the Gravelord** (don't ask).\n\nThe violence started early and often! **Gladdie Farika** introduced **Shiroma Salim** to the concept of gravity with a Morning Star to the face right out of the gate. We saw bodies hitting the floor faster than **Sir Tanos** jumping to conclusions! We had a beautiful double knockout between **Krueger Jacinthe** and **Dickenson Beker**—Spear meets Billhook, everybody wins (except them)! And speaking of Krueger Jacinthe, this maniac was so blood-crazed he actually **knocked out his own teammate**, Pulchi Benyamin! That is the kind of indiscriminate malice that brings a tear to my eye. Beautiful!\n\nThe Profits' offense was led by the absolute unit **Faina Hendrix**. This guy was everywhere! First, he runs the ball, dodging **Berkin Waters** like he was dodging a sermon from **High Priestess Oona**, and BAM! Shoots from the field for **2 points**! Later in the game, he intercepts a pass intended for Wieren Ivar and drills *another* **2-point** shot! Faina, if you ever want to switch to the **Ebon Gate Corruptors**, call me!\n\nMeanwhile, the Haven Lights couldn't hit the broad side of a barn! **Berkin Waters**, **Shiroma Salim**, **Zwart Bunns**—they all tossed the Trollball into the dirt like it was a cursed artifact. Pathetic! **Coward Tarton** tried to salvage some dignity at the end, but true to the name, missed the mark completely!\n\nThe Profits sealed the deal when **Yoshi Cathy** went on a tear, running through the entire Haven defense. **Marlane Lounge** tried to stop him, but Yoshi laughed in the face of danger and slammed that leather head home for a **Touchdown**! \n\nSo, to the **Temple of Light**, to the **Shield**, and to all you heroes thinking your \"Twinlight's Glow\" would save you: **LOOK UPON THE SCOREBOARD AND DESPAIR!** The Guild's money might be dirty, but their victory is crystal clear! \n\nThis is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off. Remember: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how many bones you break along the way! Goodnight, Osterra!","week":2,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":5,"slug":"haven-new-prosperity-2"}
