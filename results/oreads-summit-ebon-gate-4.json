microphone, **Nok the Corrupter**, coming to you LIVE from the dizzying, nauseating heights of **The High-Pass Pitch**! Holy cow, folks, the air is thin up here! I can barely breathe, and I don't even *need* to breathe! We’ve got a real barn-burner of a Week 4 matchup today, and I am absolutely vibrating with excitement—or maybe that's just the vertigo setting in!\n\nVisiting these treacherous peaks today is the team that holds the black, beating heart of my affection, the pride of the Sinking Field, **THE EBON GATE CORRUPTORS**! 😈 They’ve marched up the mountain to face off against the locals, **The Oread's Summit Tamers**! Now, I try to stay neutral, folks, you know I do, but let's look at the facts! While the Tamers were in their locker room sharing a cup of—get this—*non-alcoholic grog* with **Zadoc Wyatan** (boring!), the Corruptors were getting ready the right way! I saw **Terle Chenay** in the tunnel seeing who could belch the loudest, and **Smith Syst** was daring rookies to eat live worms! That’s the kind of gut-rot fortitude you need to win in the Everwar!\n\n**Kython** and his little circus of **Prismatic Troups** might think they own the sky, but they’re about to get grounded! **Simsar Carrelli** is out there counting the clouds, but he better keep his head on a swivel because the Tamers are looking to protect their home turf. Will the thin air choke the Corruptors, or will the Tamers freeze when the real heat arrives? Grab a drink—preferably something stronger than Zadoc's punch—and buckle up! **IT'S TROLLBALL TIME!** 🩸🏈","postGame":"# 🏁 FINAL: CORRUPTORS CRUSH THE SUMMIT! 🏁\n\n**HOLY MACKEREL, WHAT A GAME!** 🤯 Put a mark in the win column for the bad guys, folks! The final score is **The Ebon Gate Corruptors 2, The Oread's Summit Tamers 0**! A shutout! A glorious, violent shutout! The mountain has been conquered, and the Corruptors are coming down with the victory loot!\n\nLet’s recap the carnage, shall we? The game started off scrappy, with more missed tackles than a goblin trying to catch a greased pig. But then the bodies started hitting the floor! **Amedeo Bari**—what a champ—laid a slobber... er, a *bone-shattering* hit on **Zadoc Wyatan**, sending them to the dirt early! But I’ll give credit where it's due, the Tamers' **Dric Trilley** was a one-demon wrecking crew, taking out both **Ahasuerus An** and **Olnek Vizzone** back-to-back! The healers were working overtime before we even hit the half!\n\nSpeaking of the half, we went into the break tied at goose eggs, thanks to a wild interception by the Tamers' **Zadoc Wyatan** picking off **As Utter**. But the second half? **PURE CORRUPTION MAGIC!** ✨ After the break, **Smith Syst**—fresh off her worm diet—took that troll head, sprinted down the field, and launched a rocket from the 2-point line! **BOOM! SCORE!** That’s how you do it! \n\nThe Tamers tried to respond, bless their hearts. **Alwyn Wandy** lined up a shot from the Away Field to tie it up... and **MISSED**! Wide right! Maybe the wind took it? Maybe the guilt of being associated with **Caenis the Fatebreaker** weighed down the ball? Who knows! Ha!\n\nThe rest of the game was a masterclass in pain. **Ellette Paz** nearly took **Odericus Juxon's** head off with a beautiful tackle, and **Judi Carrington** made sure **Zadoc Wyatan** regretted waking up today with another crushing injury! The Corruptors held the line, ignored the altitude, and proved that mud is thicker than mountain air!\n\nSo there you have it, folks! The **Ebon Gate Corruptors** walk away victorious, leaving the **Oread's Summit Tamers** to nurse their wounds and drink their sad, juice-box grog. This is **Nok the Corrupter**, signing off! Remember: It's not about whether you win or lose, it's about how much permanent damage you inflict along the way!
