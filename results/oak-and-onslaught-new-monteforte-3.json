This is your favorite announcer, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live with what promises to be an absolute spectacle of carnage and athletic prowess! Tonight, we have a real barn-burner for you as the hometown heroes, Oak & Onslaught, host the visiting bruisers, The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures!\n\nNow folks, Oak & Onslaught are playing on their home turf at Fletchings Field, and you know what that means! The local druids have been hard at work, so we can expect some 'Shifting Terrain' tonight! Trees might just get up and walk, gullies could open up at any moment – it's a beautiful, unpredictable mess out there! These Wardens, like that fancy archer Sir Randy, love their nature, and tonight they're making it part of the game! Let's see if it helps them or just gets in the way of the real action.\n\nBut don't you count out the visitors! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures are a tough bunch, hailing from Dame Terra Monteforte's neck of the woods. Their healer, Lian Denton, gets ready for the game by drinking a shot of hot gravy! You heard me right, folks, HOT GRAVY! If that doesn't tell you they're here for a good time and a messy fight, I don't know what will! Keep an eye on Gabriele Klehm, who warms up by kissing the Trollball right on its stitched nose. A little tenderness before the tenderizing begins! It's the disciplined chaos of the Wardens versus the pure, unadulterated chaos of New Monteforte! Get your popcorn ready, this is going to be one for the ages!","postGame":"WHAT A GAME, FOLKS! WHAT! A! GAME! Blood, mud, and a two-point stunner! That's Trollball at its finest, and your final score from Fletchings Field is The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures: 2, and the hometown Oak & Onslaught: 0! A shutout victory on the road for the Chaos Creatures!\n\nThe first half was a masterclass in mutual destruction! It was a beautiful, beautiful stalemate of pure violence. The whistle blew and not ten seconds later, Hole Bowerman of Oak & Onslaught was knocked clean out by Gabriele Klehm, who was ALSO knocked out in the exchange! A double KO to start the party! You love to see it!\n\nThe ball spent more time on the grass than in anyone's hands! Wolbrom Ariella picked it up only to get into another double knockout with Milt Casady. It was a revolving door of consciousness out there! The healers were sprinting back and forth like panicked goblins, and I loved every second of it!\n\nPlayers were dropping left and right! Raouf Dragone and Affra Yanaton took each other out! Wolbrom Ariella and Millham Evangeline sent each other to dreamland! It was a glorious, scoreless slugfest, and by the time the halftime whistle blew, the field was littered with warriors taking a well-deserved nap.\n\nAfter the break, the Chaos Creatures came out with fire in their eyes! Alben Diantha scooped up the ball, dodged a block from Abner Seidel, and made a slick pass to Placido Kora. The crowd was on the edge of their seats!\n\nAnd then it happened! The play of the game! Placido Kora, cool as a demon's soul, took aim from the Home 2-Point zone... and SHOT! The ball sailed through the air, a perfect arc of stitched leather, and went straight through the goal! TWO POINTS for the Chaos Creatures! An absolute thing of beauty!\n\nOak & Onslaught, to their credit, didn't just lie down. They fought back with everything they had. Affra Yanaton made a heroic run, trying to answer back for the home team.\n\nBut the Chaos Creatures' defense was a brick wall with spikes! Alben Diantha flattened Affra Yanaton, though they took each other out in the process. That's the kind of sacrifice that wins championships, folks!\n\nNormi Glaudia gave the home crowd a spark of hope, picking up the loose ball and charging all the way into scoring territory! The comeback was on! You could feel the tension!\n\nBut it was not to be! Fogel Raynold of the Chaos Creatures came flying in and laid out Normi Glaudia right at the goal line! Another double KO, another dream shattered! The ball lay tantalizingly close to the goal, but time ran out on the Wardens.\n\nAnd that's the final whistle! The New Monteforte Chaos Creatures came into a hostile, shifting stadium and taught the Wardens a lesson in beautiful brutality! A well-earned victory, sealed by a single, perfect shot. This is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that while 'heroes' are busy with their politics, the real legends are being made right here on the Trollball field! Until next time, stay bloody!","week":3,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":2,"slug":"oak-and-onslaught-new-monteforte-3"}
