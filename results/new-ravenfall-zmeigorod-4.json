NIGHT TROLLBALL** spectacular! We are broadcasting from the high ramparts of **The Stronghold Bailey** in New Ravenfall! The air is thin, the drop is steep, and the field is made of packed earth and UNFORGIVING COBBLESTONE! It’s the perfect recipe for skinned knees and broken dreams! Ha ha ha!\n\nLet’s meet our combatants! Visiting from the sinking swamps, we have **The Zmeigorod Snessengers**! 🐍 I was down in the locker room earlier and the smell was... memorable! I watched **Delija Dowling** chug a raw egg—shell and all! CRUNCHY! That’s the kind of calcium uptake I like to see! And their healer, **Waldon Tadeo**, was rubbing some foul mushroom paste on everyone's elbows. Let's hope that fungus helps them bounce off the pavement! They hail from the lands of **The Grove**, domain of the Bog Queen Valos and High Priestess Oona—that woman who keeps executing my friends. BOO! Let's see if the Snessengers can slide their way to victory!\n\nDefending the castle, it's **The New Ravenfall Commanders**! 🏰 These soldiers look ready for war! **Rhett Gavrilla** was seen collecting pebbles from the pitch—probably to sharpen their axe with! And **Jozef Pepe** is leading a belching contest on the sidelines! CLASSY! They represent the faction of **Eponore**. You know, Sir Tanos the Bold and Artorias the Moonslayer? Those shiny, self-righteous \"heroes\" who think they’re better than us demons? Well, tonight, their team better be ready to get dirty!\n\nWill the Commanders hold the fort? Or will the Snessengers swamp the competition? Grab a drink, lock your doors, and PRAY for overtime! **IT'S TROLLBALL TIME!**","postGame":"# AND THAT IS THE GAME! 🏁\n\n**FINAL SCORE: The New Ravenfall Commanders 1, The Zmeigorod Snessengers 0!**\n\nHoly smokes, folks! It wasn't a high-scoring affair, but it was a BONA FIDE BRAWL! The Commanders turned The Stronghold Bailey into a torture chamber tonight! The pavement is stained red, and the healers are earning their paychecks!\n\nThe violence started early and NEVER STOPPED! **Dusa Curson** of the Commanders came out swinging like a maniac! Early in the first half, Dusa tackled **Alded Sanjay** and sent them straight to the mat with a CRACK! 🚑 But the Commanders weren't done! **Jessalin Zobias** laid a brutal hit on **Kleinstein MacGregor**, taking them out of the game! The Snessengers tried to respond, but their offense was sloppier than their swamp! **Delija Dowling** and **Gere Cordelie** both missed shots on goal! You can't win if you can't aim, folks!\n\n**Jozef Pepe** kept the pain train rolling for Ravenfall, injuring **Arni Griffith** right before the break! The Snessengers' healer, Waldon Tadeo, had to use every mushroom in the bag to get those players back for the second half!\n\nAfter halftime, the deadlock finally broke! **Jessalin Zobias**—who was already having a killer game—sprinted into the End Zone and **DUNKED THE BALL** for a TOUCHDOWN! 🏀 That single point would prove to be enough!\n\nBut Dusa Curson wasn't satisfied with just one victim! In the second half, Dusa INJURED **Kleinstein MacGregor** (again!) and then took out **Rose Kluge** for good measure! THAT IS A HAT-TRICK OF HOSPITALIZATIONS! GIVE THAT DEMON A RAISE! 🔥\n\nThe Snessengers managed one moment of defiance when **Rose Kluge** injured **Theis Loredo**, but it was too little, too late. **Croteau Osmo** added insult to injury by crushing **Dare Wynnie**, and **Alded Sanjay** threw a desperate pass that was picked off by **Pirozzo Opal** to seal the deal.\n\nA masterclass in brutality from the New Ravenfall Commanders! Artorias and Tanos might be insufferable do-gooders, but their team knows how to HURT people, and I respect that! The Snessengers slither back to the swamp with a goose egg on the scoreboard and a lot of bruises! \n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! Remember: It's not about winning or losing, it's about how many bones you break along the way!
