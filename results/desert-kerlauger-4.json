violence, coming to you LIVE for another blood-soaked edition of **Tuesday Night Trollball!** We are broadcasting from the sweltering, unforgiving dunes of the Great Desert at the **Sun-Baked Bowl**! ☀️ It is hot, it is sandy, and folks, the air is absolutely shimmering with heat waves and bad intentions! \n\nTonight, we have a clash that promises to be as gritty as the sand in your teeth! In the visiting corner, emerging from the fog and ruins, we have **The Kerlauger Runeguard**! 🌫️ Rumor has it these folks are associated with the White Ravens—hello to Dame Terra, keep doing your dirty work, my dear! I saw **Harilda Sigsmond** down on the field earlier leading a synchronized chant that got louder and louder until my ears started ringing! That is the kind of psychological warfare I love to see! And let's not forget **Vivia Namara**, who was literally slapping themself in the face to get hyped. That is dedication to the pain! 😤\n\nFacing them, defending their sandy turf, are **The Desert Spectres**! 💀 Associates of Geth the Gravelord—a skeleton of taste, if I do say so myself. I caught **Steve**—just Steve—organizing a betting pool on the sidelines about who draws first blood. I put five gold pieces on \"everyone.\" And look at **Angelita Darce**, who shaved half their mustache for luck. It looks ridiculous. I love it! 😂\n\nBut wait, there is a twist! 🚨 The commissioners have declared this an **OPEN BAR MATCH**! 🍺🍷 That is right! The kegs are tapped, the spirits are high, and by the fourth quarter, we expect the coordination to be at an all-time low! Will the heat dehydrate them, or will the ale drown them? Let’s find out! Grab a cold one, folks, because **IT’S TROLLBALL TIME!** 👹🏈","postGame":"🏁 **AND THAT IS THE GAME!** The dust has settled, the sun has set, and the hangovers are already beginning! 🌙 The **Kerlauger Runeguard** have marched into the desert and pitched a shutout, defeating **The Desert Spectres** with a final score of **3 to 0**! 🏆 What a display of drunken dominance!\n\nThe match started fast and furious! **Harilda Sigsmond** snagged that Trollball early, and the violence was instantaneous. We saw **Lashondra Niehaus** absolutely CRUSH Lovash Marius into the sand—INJURY number one, folks! 🚑 That is how you start a Tuesday! But the Spectres bit back, with **Shelman McQuoid** taking Reginauld Cordell out of the equation temporarily. A tit-for-tat exchange of bodily harm! 💥\n\nDespite the heat, **Shepperd Trefler** of the Runeguard kept a cool head—well, until the ale hit him later. He found a lane, dodged the clumsy tackle attempts of the Spectres, and **DUNKED** that leather head right into the basket! 🏀 **1-0 Runeguard!** And you know what that means? **DRINK!** 🍻 The alcohol started flowing, and the coordination started dropping immediately.\n\nThe violence from Kerlauger was relentless! **Lorilee Aldred** decided that scoring wasn't enough and flattened Fidellia Mozelle, sending them to the healer's tent. ⛺ And **Harilda Sigsmond**? An absolute unit today! Harilda took out Huesman Ring AND Muscolo Jaehne in quick succession! It was like bowling with bodies out there! 🎳 The Spectres' healer, Verlee Dacia, was working overtime while the rest of the team was working on their buzz.\n\nWe went into halftime with the Runeguard up by one, and the Spectres looking thirsty—and I don't mean for water! 🏜️ After the break, the players stumbled back onto the field, injuries magically knitted but livers heavily taxed. **Vivia Namara** wasted no time adding to the casualty list, planting Shelman McQuoid into the dune face-first. INJURY! 🤕\n\nThen came the play of the game! 🌟 **Lorilee Aldred**, looking a bit tipsy and swaying in the wind, launched a Shoot from Home Field! It arced through the shimmering heat, defied physics and sobriety, and **SCORED!** 🎯 That is 2 points, bringing the lead to **3-0**! The crowd went wild, or maybe they just passed out from heatstroke! Who cares!\n\nBy the late game, it was absolute chaos. **Bahr Ethelstan** was stumbling around like a zombie—Geth would be proud—and **Reginauld Cordell** was absolutely WASTED. 🥴 But drunken strength is still strength! Reginauld, barely able to stand, managed to tackle Heyes Iver and **INJURE** them! How do you tackle someone when you can see three of them? You tackle the one in the middle! Brilliant strategy! 🧠\n\nThe Spectres tried to mount a comeback, with **Muscolo Jaehne** and **Heyes Iver** trying to run the ball, but they were zig-zagging so much they probably ran an extra mile for nothing. 😂 The Runeguard defense, led by a very blurry-eyed **Johnna Beetner**, held the line.\n\nIn the end, the **Kerlauger Runeguard** proved that they can hold their liquor better than the desert dwellers! The White Ravens should be proud; their training in those uneven ruins clearly prepares you for stumbling around drunk! 🦅 As for the Spectres... well, Geth might want to raise some players with higher tolerance next time.\n\nThis has been **Nok the Corrupter**, reminding you that whether you win or lose, it doesn't matter as long as someone gets hurt! See you next Tuesday! 👋😈","week":4,"homeScore":0,"awayScore":3,"slug":"desert-kerlauger-4","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Harilda Sigsmond in zone Center Field","undefined","Angelita Darce tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Angelita Darce tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Lorilee Aldred tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Lorilee Aldred tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Lovash Marius tries to Tackle Vivia Namara, but misses!","Lovash Marius tries to Tackle Vivia Namara, but misses!","Steve tries to Tackle Reginauld Cordell, but Reginauld Cordell blocks it!","Steve tries to Tackle Reginauld Cordell, but Reginauld Cordell blocks it!","Vivia Namara runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Vivia Namara runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Lashondra Niehaus Tackles Lovash Marius and INJURES THEM!","Lashondra Niehaus Tackles Lovash Marius and INJURES THEM!","Steve tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Steve tries to Tackle Lorilee Aldred, but Lorilee Aldred blocks it!","Shelman McQuoid Tackles Reginauld Cordell and INJURES THEM!","Shelman McQuoid Tackles Reginauld Cordell and INJURES THEM!","Shepperd Trefler tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Shepperd Trefler tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Johnna Beetner runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Johnna Beetner runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Lorilee Aldred tries to Tackle Fidellia Mozelle, but Fidellia Mozelle blocks it!","Lorilee Aldred tries to Tackle Fidellia Mozelle, but Fidellia Mozelle blocks it!","Muscolo Jaehne Tackles Lashondra Niehaus and INJURES THEM!","Muscolo Jaehne Tackles Lashondra Niehaus and INJURES THEM!","Eal Caundra has returned Reginauld Cordell to play","Reginauld Cordell tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Reginauld Cordell tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Steve tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Steve tries to Tackle Harilda Sigsmond, but misses!","Eileen Mikihisa tries to Tackle Shepperd Trefler, but Shepperd Trefler blocks it!","Eileen Mikihisa tries to Tackle Shepperd Trefler, but Shepperd Trefler blocks it!","Steve tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but Gurney Fadiman blocks it!","Steve tries to Tackle Gurney Fadiman, but Gurney Fadiman blocks it!","Shepperd Trefler runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","Goal scored!
