This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the magnificent Stronghold Bailey in New Ravenfall! The air is electric, the cobblestones are cold, and the crowd is howling from the ramparts, just aching for some righteous violence! And what a matchup we have for you tonight, folks!\n\nIn one corner, we have the visiting team, all the way from the chilly frontier, The South Pole Yetis! These are some tough customers, hardened by the cold and ready to rumble. I've been watching their warm-ups, and it is a sight to behold! You've got Isborne Krause getting his teammate to wallop him in the shoulder just to get the blood flowing, and the delightful Udela Dorkus over there... is she licking a whetstone? She is! That's the kind of dedication you love to see in this sport! This team is hungry, and they've traveled a long way to knock some heads. 🥶\n\nAnd in the home corner, behold The New Ravenfall Commanders! Playing on their home turf, with the echoes of the castle amplifying every brutal hit! These players are sponsored by some of the realm's most... notable personalities. Yes, friends, I'm talking about the likes of Sir Tanos and that so-called God King, Artorias. I'm sure they'll be watching from their comfortable towers, clutching their pearls at the beautiful carnage their team is about to unleash! The Commanders are getting ready in their own special ways, with Estes Adrian munching on honeycomb for a 'sweet' victory and Theis Loredo sharing a bit of fermented fish. It smells like victory, or something like it! 🏰\n\nTwo teams, one troll head, and a whole lot of mayhem on the way! Will the scrappy Yetis from the south pull off an upset on the cobblestone pitch? Or will the Commanders defend their stronghold with iron and fury? Stick around, folks, because the opening whistle is about to blow, and you don't want to miss a single, bone-crunching second! 💥","postGame":"HOLY SMOKES, FANS! That was a game for the ages! 🤯 If your heart is still pounding, you're not alone! What a comeback! What a battle! When the final whistle blew after a grueling overtime, it was your New Ravenfall Commanders who stood victorious over The South Pole Yetis with a final score of 5 to 3! An absolute spectacle of grit and carnage!\n\nThe second half opened with the Yetis looking to run away with it! They were already sitting on a lead when play resumed, and they came out swinging! Hilaire Guevara wasted no time, snatching up the troll head and dodging a block from Jessalin Zobias to get into scoring position. She looked, she aimed, and she launched a perfect two-point shot! SWISH! 🎯 The Yetis extend their lead, and the home crowd was stunned into silence!\n\nBut the Commanders weren't about to lie down in their own bailey! The bodies started flying immediately. Coussoule Bidle of the Yetis took out Fleme Alis with a nasty mallet strike, but the Commanders' Rhett Gavrilla answered right back, putting Ajit Serge on the ice with that massive Woodsman's Axe of theirs! It was a meat grinder out there, folks! 🪓\n\nThe Yetis kept the pressure on. Duky Orelee, showing some real fancy footwork, scooped up the ball and blazed into the home field, slipping right past Pirozzo Opal. He drove straight for the goal, shrugging off a last-ditch effort from Dusa Curson to score another point for the South Pole! It was all Yetis, all the time!\n\nThen, the tide began to turn. The middle of the half was a beautiful, bloody stalemate. Weapons were ringing, players were dropping, and the healers were earning their keep! Moir Sass laid out Selima Si with a trident, and then Rhett Gavrilla, that absolute menace, knocked out Sale Tocci! Theis Loredo then sent Tocci *back* to the healer's tent for good measure! It was glorious chaos! 💥\n\nThe Commanders fought for every inch. Fleme Alis got the ball and connected on a fantastic pass to Jessalin Zobias, who made a desperate lunge for the goal! He came up just short, but the ball was deep in enemy territory. And then, the play of the game! Udela Dorkus scooped up the loose ball, but Jessalin Zobias met her in a furious clash! The Quarterstaff met the Military Fork, and BOTH players went down in a heap! A double knockout! The troll head was loose, and the game was up for grabs! ⚔️\n\nSomehow, in that whirlwind of violence that followed, the Commanders clawed their way back! The official scorers could barely keep up with the action, but points were scored, bones were broken, and by the end of regulation, the score was tied! We were headed to OVERTIME, folks!\n\nThe overtime period was a cagey affair, with both teams exhausted but desperate. Passes were fumbled, runs were stuffed, and the tension was thick enough to chew! We saw another magnificent double KO, as Hilaire Guevara and Theis Loredo took each other out of the action simultaneously! This is Trollball at its finest, my friends!\n\nTurnovers galore! Pirozzo Opal had the ball, but Coussoule Bidle ripped it right out of his hands! Then Sayers Erdda tried a run, only to be stuffed by Fleme Alis, who took the ball for the Commanders! The momentum was swinging like a pendulum! Fleme Alis went on an absolute tear, knocking out two Yetis players in quick succession!\n\nAnd then, with time ticking away, it happened. Theis Loredo, back in the game and looking for revenge, got her hands on the ball in scoring range. The Yetis defense scrambled, but it was too late! She fired a perfect shot, right through the goal for TWO POINTS! The crowd erupted! 🎊 The New Ravenfall Commanders win it in overtime! What a finish! A stunning comeback victory for the home team! I bet even Artorias cracked a smile at that one... or maybe he just called his guards. Who cares! What a game! 🏆","week":3,"homeScore":5,"awayScore":3,"slug":"new-ravenfall-south-pole-3"}
