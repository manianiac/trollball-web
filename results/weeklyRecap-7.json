This is your favorite demon of the airwaves, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you with the delightful dirt on Week 7 of the most glorious sport in Osterra! We’ve had a week filled with more surprises than a mimic in a furniture store! From overtime thrillers to booze-soaked blowouts, this week had everything except a smile on my face during my beloved Ebon Gate Corruptors' match! But enough about my personal tragedy, let’s wade through the viscera and see who came out on top! 🦴💥\n\n### 🕯️ THE LIGHTS GO OUT IN NEW RAVENFALL!\n\nFirst and foremost, let’s talk about the absolute highlight of the century—the **Haven Lights** got absolutely flattened by the **New Ravenfall Commanders**! HA! You love to see it! Those shiny, self-righteous goody-two-shoes were led by Riffle Harrington, who was hopping around on tied-together bootlaces like a malfunctioning wind-up toy. Despite Riffle Heyde trying to break Jozef Pepe in half early on, the Commanders held their ground in the Stronghold Bailey. The real kicker? Croteau Osmo returned from the infirmary to sink a massive 2-point shot from center field that extinguished the Lights' hopes faster than a bucket of water on a campfire. Final score: 2-1 for the Commanders! Take that, Sir Artorias! Go polish your Moonslayer and cry about it! 🏰❌\n\n### 🍻 OPEN BAR OBLITERATION: LIQUOR AND LOSSES\n\nWe had two matches where the taps were flowing like the River Styx, and the results were a beautiful, blurry mess! Up at Oread’s Summit, the Tamers showed no mercy to the **Southport Narwhals**, serving up a 5-0 shutout that was as cold as King Nezmear's heart. Saloma Talich was firing off shots while everyone else was seeing double, and poor Malcolm Goer spent more time rubbing the ball in his armpits than actually scoring. It was an absolute tavern-clearing slaughter! 🏔️🍺\n\nMeanwhile, in the dunes, **Oak & Onslaught** left the **Desert Spectres** in a drunken dust-storm, winning 5-2. Hole Bowerman was stumbling around like a newborn fawn but somehow managed to dunk the troll head twice! It’s amazing what a little liquid courage (and total loss of motor control) can do for your game. Even Geth the Gravelord couldn't save his boys from the Warden-backed ruffians. Maybe they should have tried drinking more sand? 🌵🥃\n\n### ⏱️ THE OVERTIME OPERAS: MARATHONS OF MAYHEM\n\nIf you like your games long and your medical bills longer, we had two sudden-death screamers this week! In the Su'akour Bowl, the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** clawed out a 3-2 overtime win against the **Confluence Captains**. Campball Fink was charging around barefoot in mud puddles like a lunatic, and Bollinger Susette sealed the deal after Oona Jane delivered a pass smoother than a lie from a Fey hater! 🦴🔥\n\nDown at the fort, the **Tortell Privateers** plundered a 5-4 overtime win against the **Kerlauger Runeguard**. This one was a regular meat grinder, folks! Loralee Sunny was a bolt of lightning, and Vivia Namara was a one-woman wrecking crew, demolitioning everyone in sight. It was a narrow win, but seeing the Runeguard fall in their own pile of rocks is always worth the price of admission! 🏴‍☠️🗡️\n\n### 🐖 THE MUD CRAWLS AND THE HEARTBREAK\n\nIn the 'frozen mud' category, the **South Pole Yetis** managed a nail-biting 1-0 win over the **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**. It was a defensive slugfest where the biggest highlights were Fogel Raynold sending half the opposition to the healer. It wasn't pretty, but since the fans there are mostly starving wolves anyway, nobody complained! ❄️🥅\n\nFinally, I have to mention the tragedy at the Prismatic Pavilion. My beloved **Ebon Gate Corruptors** fell 2-1 to the **Starlight Bazaar Bizarres**. I blame Amedeo Bari's bacon grease ritual—it was just too slippery for our own good! Aggri Cookie found the range for a 2-point 'Shoot' that just broke my black heart. Terle Chenay did her best to belch our boys back to life, but the clock ran out. But don't you worry, the Pride of the Pit will rise again! \n\nUntil next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you: if you're not bleeding, you're not trying! GOODNIGHT, OSTERRA! 🎤👹"
