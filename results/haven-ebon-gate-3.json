This is your favorite demonic announcer, Nok the Corrupter, broadcasting live from the most disgustingly clean stadium in all of Osterra, The Aegis Field! The very air here smells of soap and good intentions, it's turning my stomach! But the action on the field promises to be anything but clean!\n\nTonight, we have a classic clash of titans! In this corner, hailing from the delightful, sinking marshlands of Ebon Gate, my personal favorites, the team with more grit than a Gethic sandstorm, The EBON GATE CORRUPTORS! I've heard the locker room is pure, concentrated energy tonight! Smith Syst is daring teammates to eat live worms for luck, Judi Carrington is getting everyone's blood pumping with a sea shanty so off-key it could shatter glass, and Amedeo Bari is polishing his boots with bacon grease for that extra slippery advantage! That's how you prepare for a proper game, folks!\n\nAnd in the other corner... them. The home team, the Haven Lights. I guess they're here, too. Their pre-game rituals are... something else. We've got Riffle Heyde drinking an entire waterskin of lukewarm water—riveting stuff! And Coward Tarton is over there kissing her biceps. I suppose when you don't have any real strategy, you have to hope your muscles can think for themselves! This pristine field won't know what hit it when the Corruptors bring some real, honest-to-goodness chaos to the game. Get ready for a slobberknocker, because the Corruptors are here to play, and to break things!","postGame":"Well folks, I... I need a moment. That was one of the most brutal, back-and-forth, heart-stopping games of Trollball I have ever had the privilege to witness. The final score does not tell the whole story, not by a long shot. The Haven Lights may have taken the win with a final score of 4 to 3, but let the record show that the Ebon Gate Corruptors fought with the fury of a caged demon!\n\nRight out of the gate, after a brief halftime reset, the action was nonstop! The Lights got the ball, but did that matter to As Utter? NOT ONE BIT! He immediately went on a rampage, sending Farand Keil AND Zwart Bunns to the knockout pile with that glorious Greatsword of his! That's the spirit we love to see!\n\nThe Lights, bless their little hearts, managed to string a few passes together, but the Corruptors' pressure was immense. The ball came loose and our own Judi Carrington snatched it up, ready to make a break for it! He was stopped, but the message was sent: nothing will come easy for Haven tonight!\n\nAnd the hits just kept on coming! Olnek Vizzone laid out Dickenson Beker with his sickle! Then we saw not one, not two, but THREE sets of mutual knockouts! Carrington and Beker took each other down in a blaze of glory! Then Wieren Ivar and Napoleon Anzovin traded blows and went down together! The healers were sprinting back and forth like panicked goblins!\n\nAmidst the absolute carnage, the Corruptors showed their brilliance! After a missed shot by the Lights, Amedeo Bari picked up the troll head, dodged a block, and made a spectacular run down the field! He was just stopped short of the goal, but who was there to clean it up? The one and only Bullion Iglesias, who scooped up the ball and punched it in for a CORRUPTORS SCORE! The crowd went wild!\n\nBut the game was tied, and we were heading into the nail-biting intensity of OVERTIME! The field was a warzone! More mutual KOs! As Utter and Dickenson Beker went down swinging! Olnek Vizzone and Berkin Waters followed them to the sidelines! Smith Syst and Zwart Bunns flattened each other! It was beautiful, beautiful violence!\n\nBall carrier Farand Keil thought he had a clear path, but Olnek Vizzone, a true hero of the match, laid him out and forced the fumble! The ball was loose, a scramble ensued! Tybi Reo of the Lights got her hands on it, heaved a desperate pass... and it was FUMBLED! YES! \n\nOur chance had come! The magnificent Ellette Paz scooped up the ball for the Corruptors! This was it, folks! The game-winning run was in her sights! She dodged, she weaved, she ran for glory... only to be blocked by Riffle Heyde. A tragic, heartbreaking stop at the one-yard line.\n\nAnd then, in the cruelest twist of fate I've seen since Sir Tanos was freed from my old home, Riffle Heyde, the lukewarm water drinker, slipped through a gap and scored the winning point for the Haven Lights. A devastating finish to an incredible game.\n\nDon't you dare hang your heads, Corruptors. You left everything on that field tonight—sweat, blood, and a whole lot of unconscious opponents. You played the game the way it's meant to be played. You may have lost on the scoreboard, but you won in glorious, beautiful violence! We'll be back next week, you can count on it! This is Nok the Corrupter, signing off!","week":3,"homeScore":4,"awayScore":3,"slug":"haven-ebon-gate-3"}
