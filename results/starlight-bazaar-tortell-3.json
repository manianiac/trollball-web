This is your favorite fiend, Nok the Corrupter, coming to you live from the absolutely dazzling, and frankly quite distracting, Prismatic Pavilion! The sun is shining, the lagoon is splashing, and the stage-planks are just begging for someone to get knocked through them! What a perfect day for some wholesome violence! 🏟️✨\n\nTonight, our home team, the ever-unpredictable Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, are getting ready to put on a show! And I mean that literally! I've been watching their warm-ups, and it's pure theater! Pompei Hephzipa is out here striking poses that would make a statue blush, and Melesa Zelten is leading a chant that's rattling the very stilts of this stadium! These performers, much like their patron Kython, know that the greatest art is a well-executed tackle! They're looking loose, they're looking loud, and they look ready to rumble!\n\nBut hold on to your helmets, folks, because sailing in from Tortell, it's the Privateers! These swashbucklers from Cedar Hill aren't here to 'make things happen' with a friendly chat like Elspeth Ortell; they're here to make skulls crack! Their pre-game rituals are a thing of demonic beauty! You've got Lilithe Royce using leeches to 'lighten their step'—now that's dedication! And don't even get me started on Dib Tufts, who just chugged a raw egg, shell and all! That's the kind of energy you need to win! The Bizarres might have the home-field advantage, but the Privateers look hungry, and I, for one, can't wait to see which of these incredible teams will paint this pretty pavilion red! Let's get ready for TROLLBALLLLL! 🪓🩸","postGame":"WHAT A GAME! WHAT A GLORIOUS, BACK-AND-FORTH BRAWL! When the final whistle blew and the last groans of the downed faded away, your visiting Tortell Privateers stood victorious over the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, with a final score of 4 to 2! A spectacular display of grit and glaives, folks! An absolute masterpiece of mayhem!\n\nThe action started faster than a thief from Falric's wallet! The Privateers came out swinging, and I mean that literally! After a quick fumble, Ellan Elburt got his hands on the Trollball, but not before his teammate Goldberg Tova sent Pompei Hephzipa to the knockout zone with a beautiful swing of their Glaive! That's how you set the tone! 💥\n\nWith a man advantage, Ellan Elburt didn't hesitate! He wound up from the 2-point zone and let it fly—SWISH! Two points for the Privateers right out of the gate! The crowd here at the Pavilion was stunned silent! The Privateers kept up the pressure, with Payson Jan dropping Gagliano Tallbott for a little nap on the sidelines. The Bizarres looked rattled!\n\nBut you can't keep a good performer down! Pompei Hephzipa, fresh off the healer's table, came back with a vengeance, immediately knocking out Dib Tufts! And then, a moment of beautiful, violent poetry: Ellan Elburt and Kristin Kronfeld charged each other, weapons flashing, and took each other OUT in a spectacular double KO! You love to see it! The first half ended with another double knockout between Bush Heiner and Dib Tufts, leaving the Privateers up 2-to-nothing at the break.\n\nHalftime came and went, and the players came back refreshed and ready for more carnage! And they did not disappoint! The second half opened with YET ANOTHER double KO, this time between Willa Lois and Kidder Starkey! Three double KOs in one game! Is that a record?! I think that's a record!\n\nWith the bodies piling up, Dib Tufts of the Privateers found an opening. He saw his shot and he took it, sinking a magnificent 2-pointer from away territory! That put the visitors up 4-0, and it looked like it might be over for the Bizarres. It's the kind of decisive action that would make even a stoic like Sir Tanos crack a smile!\n\nBut hold on! The Bizarres still had some magic left! Demp Chet got the ball, shook off a defender, and fired a perfect shot of his own! TWO POINTS! The home team was on the board, and the Pavilion erupted! The score was 4-2, and the comeback was on!\n\nThe Bizarres fought tooth and nail to the very end. Melesa Zelten laid out Ellan Elburt with a spear, and the fighting was fierce across the field. Goldberg Tova was a menace all night for the Privateers, picking up a second knockout to seal their reputation as a player to watch.\n\nUltimately, time was not on the Bizarres' side. They couldn't find that last score they needed, and the game ended in the possession of the Tortell Privateers. A hard-fought, well-deserved victory for the visitors on the road!\n\nMy friends, this is what Trollball is all about! Not some lofty ideals or saving the world, but pure, unadulterated athletic competition at its most brutal and beautiful. Congratulations to the Tortell Privateers! And a hearty round of applause for the Starlight Bazaar Bizarres, who gave us a show we won't soon forget! Until next time, this is Nok the Corrupter, signing off! ❤️‍🔥","week":3,"homeScore":2,"awayScore":4,"slug":"starlight-bazaar-tortell-3"}
