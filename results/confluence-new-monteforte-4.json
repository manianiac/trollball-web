This is Nok the Corrupter, bringing you the play-by-play LIVE from the World's Spine!\"** 📻😈\n\nFolks, we are high up in the mountains tonight at **The Glowstone Terrace**! It is opulent, it is shiny, and frankly, it smells too much like money and not enough like old blood for my taste, but we work with what we have! Tonight, the **Confluence Captains** play host to the visiting **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**! It’s a battle between the Guild's finest mercenaries and the anarchists from the graffiti-covered streets of Monteforte!\n\nI’ve been watching the warm-ups, and let me tell you, the tension is thicker than a dwarf's skull! **Ladew Evelina** of the Captains is over there chugging raw eggs—shells included! *CRUNCH!* That is the kind of protein intake I like to see! Meanwhile, the Captains' **Carnahan Laud** is literally eating dandelions off the sidelines. Is the Guild of the Black Sky cutting the catering budget? Someone ask that penny-pinching Chairman Brennen Farno!\n\nOn the visitor's side, **Mouldon Earl** is hopping around like a cat on a hot tin roof, refusing to step on any of the field lines. Superstition? Madness? Who cares! As long as they step on their opponents' faces! The White Ravens might be busy playing with dirt and curses back home—hello to the lovely Dame Terra—but tonight, these Chaos Creatures are here to tear down the establishment! \n\nSo grab a cold drink, ignore the screams from the void, and **LET'S PLAY TROLLBALL!** 👹🏈","postGame":"# 🩸 POST-GAME CARNAGE REPORT 🩸\n\n**\"Holy Mackeral, what a slobberknocker! The stones of Confluence are slick with gore tonight, folks!\"**\n\nThe final whistle has blown, and the **Confluence Captains** have defended their shiny terrace with a decisive **3 to 1** victory over the **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures**! But the score doesn't tell the whole story—the infirmary is going to be busier than a necromancer on a battlefield tonight!\n\n### 🏁 The First Half\nThe game started with a scramble! Both teams were testing the waters, throwing missed tackles left and right. But then, **Stephan Lisk**—armed with a pollaxe and a dream—snatched up that leather troll head. He charged down the field, dodging a tackle from Gabriele Klehm, and **SLAMMED** it into the end zone! **TOUCHDOWN CAPTAINS!** That's 1-0!\n\nWe saw some early brutality too! **Placido Kora** of the Creatures absolutely leveled **Ladew Evelina**, sending them off the field on a stretcher! And **Urata Oriana** decided two can play at that game, taking out **Behl Berstine** with a bone-shaking hit! That's the spirit! \n\n### 🏥 The Second Half Bloodbath\nAfter a quick halftime heal-up, the violence turned up to eleven! **Vonni Geoff** of the Captains came out swinging—or rather, throwing! They launched a beauty of a shot from Away Field that sailed right through the goal! Two points! **3-0 Captains!**\n\nThen, folks, the wheels came off the wagon and crashed right into the meat grinder! It was an absolute cascade of injuries! 🚑\n*   **Tucker Hett** snapped **Caves Cestar** like a twig!\n*   **Belding Chloe** returned the favor and smashed **Boulanger Procto**!\n*   **Behl Berstine** got revenge on **Tucker Hett**!\n*   **Mouldon Earl** crushed **Ladew Evelina** (again!)!\n*   **Deach Sharlene** put **Placido Kora** in the dirt!\n\nI haven't seen this many broken bones since the last time Cyfnerth the Butcher hosted a barbecue! amidst the chaos, the Chaos Creatures finally showed some life. **Mouldon Earl**, despite their fear of lines, crossed the big one at the end of the field for a Dunk, putting Monteforte on the board! \n\n### 🏆 Final Thoughts\nIt ended **3-1**, a solid win for the Captains. The Guild of the Black Sky—led by door-loving Garon and the rest of those bureaucrats—takes home the glory. But the real winners? Us! The fans of VIOLENCE! \n\nThis is Nok the Corrupter, reminding you that if you didn't lose a tooth, you didn't play hard enough! **GOODNIGHT OSTERRA!** 🌑💀","week":4,"homeScore":3,"awayScore":1,"slug":"confluence-new-monteforte-4","plays":["The Trollball is picked up by Stephan Lisk in zone Center Field","undefined","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Carnahan Laud, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Carnahan Laud, but misses!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle O'Conner Maighdlin, but O'Conner Maighdlin blocks it!","Boulanger Procto tries to Tackle O'Conner Maighdlin, but O'Conner Maighdlin blocks it!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but misses!","Behl Berstine runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Behl Berstine runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Caves Cestar, but misses!","Placido Kora tries to Tackle Caves Cestar, but misses!","Richia Pazit tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Richia Pazit tries to Tackle Tucker Hett, but misses!","Carnahan Laud tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but Placido Kora blocks it!","Carnahan Laud tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but Placido Kora blocks it!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Richia Pazit, but misses!","Raouf Dragone tries to Tackle Richia Pazit, but misses!","Deach Sharlene passes the ball to Behl Berstine!","Deach Sharlene passes the ball to Behl Berstine!","Carnahan Laud throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","Carnahan Laud throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Tucker Hett in zone Away Field","Fogel Raynold throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","Fogel Raynold throws a wild pass and it lands on the ground!","The Trollball is picked up by Deach Sharlene in zone Away Field","Placido Kora Tackles Ladew Evelina and INJURES THEM!","Placido Kora Tackles Ladew Evelina and INJURES THEM!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but Belding Chloe blocks it!","Urata Oriana tries to Tackle Belding Chloe, but Belding Chloe blocks it!","Belding Chloe shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","Belding Chloe shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Vonni Geoff in zone Away Field","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Gabriele Klehm tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","O'Conner Maighdlin shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","O'Conner Maighdlin shoots from Away Field but misses the goal!","The Trollball is picked up by Vonni Geoff in zone Away Field","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Deach Sharlene, but misses!","Alben Diantha tries to Tackle Deach Sharlene, but misses!","Richia Pazit passes the ball to Deach Sharlene!","Richia Pazit passes the ball to Deach Sharlene!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Wolbrom Ariella tries to Tackle Stephan Lisk, but Stephan Lisk blocks it!","Deach Sharlene runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Deach Sharlene runs with the ball and advances towards the goal!","Urata Oriana Tackles Behl Berstine and INJURES THEM!","Urata Oriana Tackles Behl Berstine and INJURES THEM!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","O'Conner Maighdlin tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Caves Cestar tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Caves Cestar tries to Tackle Placido Kora, but misses!","Richia Pazit tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Richia Pazit tries to run with the ball but is stopped by the defense!","Stephan Lisk runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","Stephan Lisk runs into the End Zone and DUNKS THE BALL INTO THE GOAL!","The Trollball is picked up by Caves Cestar in zone Center Field","HALFTIME -
