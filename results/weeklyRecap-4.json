If you thought last week was chaotic, you clearly haven't seen what happens when you give heavy weaponry to athletes and tell them the drinks are free! \n\nWe had the highest-scoring game I have ever seen, a parade of humiliations via shutout, and my personal favorite—**THE EBON GATE CORRUPTORS WINNING!** Let's wade through the viscera, shall we?\n\n## 🍺 THE OPEN BAR INSANITY 🍺\n\nSomeone at the league office—probably **Yarp** trying to cover a spread—decided to declare TWO matches as **Open Bar Events**, and the results were absolute bedlam!\n\n**The Starlight Bazaar Bizarres** hosted **The Wyrmwood Stronghammers** in a game that defied logic, sobriety, and physics. The final score was an eye-watering **8 to 7** in favor of the Bizarres! 🤯 Folks, that is **15 points** scored by people who could barely walk in a straight line! \n\nThe highlight? **Kristin Kronfeld** of the Bizarres passing the ball TO HERSELF in the endzone for a dunk! Talk about narcissism! **Kython** must be so proud of his glittery little psychopaths. Meanwhile, the Stronghammers fought hard, but maybe **Hamburger Marthe** shouldn't have shoved quite so many beans up his nose before drinking that much ale!\n\nIn the other drunken brawl, **The Kerlauger Runeguard** proved they have iron livers to match their iron armor. They marched into the **Desert Spectres'** oven and pitched a **3-0 SHUTOUT**! 🛡️ **Shepperd Trefler** dunked, **Lorilee Aldred** shot from downtown, and **Reginauld Cordell** managed to injure an opponent while completely wasted! That is functional alcoholism at its finest! The White Ravens should be proud!\n\n## 🛑 SHUTOUT CITY: THE WALLS WERE UP! 🛑\n\nSpeaking of goose eggs, this week was a defensive nightmare for half the league. We saw **FIVE SHUTOUTS**! \n\n1.  **My Ebon Gate Corruptors 2 - Oread's Summit Tamers 0:** HA! VICTORY! **Smith Syst** scored a 2-point screamer, and **Amedeo Bari** polished his boots with the tears of the Tamers! The Corruptors conquer the altitude! 🌋\n2.  **The Greenwatch 4 - Southport Narwhals 0:** A total dismantling. **Sir Randy's** favorites walked all over the cliffside. The Narwhals couldn't catch a cold, let alone the ball.\n3.  **New Ravenfall Commanders 1 - Zmeigorod Snessengers 0:** Listen, I know the Snessengers are the \"popular\" vote right now. The Discord loves them. But popularity didn't stop **Dusa Curson** from achieving a **HAT TRICK OF HOSPITALIZATIONS**! 🚑 Three injuries caused by one player! The Eponore defense was a brick wall, and the snakes got stepped on.\n\n## 🤮 THE TRAVESTY AT HAVEN 🤮\n\nI regret to inform you that **The Haven Lights** destroyed **Oak & Onslaught** **5-0**. \n\nIt makes me physically ill to type this. **Tybi Reo** scored twice. **Shiroma Salim** scored. They were flawless. They were efficient. They were boringly perfect. **Sir Artorias** is probably commissioning a statue of himself to celebrate. Gross. Move on!\n\n## 💰 HOSTILE TAKEOVERS & OT THRILLERS 💰\n\nFinally, we had the **New Prosperity Profits** taking on the **Brimstone Fire Eaters** in the ruins. This one went to **OVERTIME**! ⏰\n\nIt was a grinder! The Fire Eaters fought hard (shoutout to **Nachison Icken** for playing with boots on the wrong feet and still injuring people), but the Guild's money won out in the end. **Aufmann Tedric** hit the game-winning shot in extra time for a **4-2** victory. **Chairman Brennen Farno** can add another win to his ledger, the greedy stiff.\n\nIn the only other game, the **Confluence Captains** beat the **New Monteforte Chaos Creatures** **3-1**. The Captains just have too much firepower at home. Sorry, **Dame Terra**, your dirt wizards couldn't stop the cash flow!\n\n---\n\nWhat a week! The popular teams cried, the drunks scored a million points, and I am a happy demon! This is **Nok the Corrupter**, reminding you that the only thing better than winning is making sure your opponent needs a healer! **GOODNIGHT, OSTERRA!** 😈"}
